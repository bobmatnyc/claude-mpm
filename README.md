# Claude MPM - Multi-Agent Project Manager

A powerful orchestration framework for Claude Code that enables multi-agent workflows, session management, and real-time monitoring through a streamlined Rich-based interface.

> **Quick Start**: See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) to get running in 5 minutes!

## Features

- 🤖 **Multi-Agent System**: 15 specialized agents for comprehensive project management
- 🧠 **Persistent Knowledge System**: Project-specific kuzu-memory integration for intelligent context retention
- 🔄 **Session Management**: Resume previous sessions with `--resume`
- 📊 **Real-Time Monitoring**: Live dashboard with `--monitor` flag
- 🔌 **Auto-Installing MCP Services**: mcp-vector-search and kuzu-memory automatically installed via pipx
- 📁 **Multi-Project Support**: Per-session working directories with persistent knowledge graphs
- 🔍 **Git Integration**: View diffs and track changes across projects
- 🎯 **Smart Task Orchestration**: PM agent intelligently routes work to specialists
- ⚡ **Simplified Architecture**: ~3,700 lines removed for better performance and maintainability
- 🔒 **Enhanced Security**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization framework

## Quick Installation

```bash
pip install claude-mpm
```

Or with pipx (recommended for isolated installation):
```bash
# Install with monitor support (recommended)
pipx install "claude-mpm[monitor]"

# Basic installation without monitor
pipx install claude-mpm

# Configure MCP for pipx users:
claude-mpm mcp-pipx-config
```

**💡 Pipx Tip**: Use `"claude-mpm[monitor]"` to get full monitoring dashboard functionality! The `[monitor]` optional dependency includes Socket.IO and async web server components needed for real-time agent monitoring.

**🎉 Pipx Support Now Fully Functional!** Recent improvements ensure complete compatibility:
- ✅ Socket.IO daemon script path resolution (fixed)
- ✅ Commands directory access (fixed) 
- ✅ Resource files properly packaged for pipx environments
- ✅ Python 3.13+ fully supported

**That's it!** See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for immediate usage or [docs/user/installation.md](docs/user/installation.md) for advanced options.

## Quick Usage

```bash
# Start interactive mode (recommended)
claude-mpm

# Start with monitoring dashboard
claude-mpm run --monitor

# Use MCP Gateway for external tool integration
claude-mpm mcp

# Run health diagnostics  
claude-mpm doctor

# Manage memory for large conversation histories
claude-mpm cleanup-memory
```

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for complete usage examples.


## Architecture (v4.4.1)

Following Phase 3 architectural simplification in v4.4.1, Claude MPM features:

- **Streamlined Rich Interface**: Removed complex TUI system (~2,500 lines) for cleaner user experience
- **Auto-Installing MCP Services**: mcp-vector-search and kuzu-memory install automatically via pipx
- **Persistent Knowledge System**: Project-specific kuzu-memory databases with intelligent prompt enrichment
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Simplified five specialized service domains
- **Interface-Based Contracts**: All services implement explicit interfaces
- **Enhanced Performance**: ~3,700 lines removed for better startup time and maintainability
- **Enhanced Security**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization framework

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture information.

## Key Capabilities

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Claude MPM includes 15 specialized agents:

#### Core Development
- **Engineer** - Software development and implementation
- **Research** - Code analysis and research  
- **Documentation** - Documentation creation and maintenance
- **QA** - Testing and quality assurance
- **Security** - Security analysis and implementation

#### Operations & Infrastructure
- **Ops** - Operations and deployment with advanced git commit authority and security verification (v2.2.2+)
- **Version Control** - Git and version management
- **Data Engineer** - Data pipeline and ETL development

#### Web Development
- **Web UI** - Frontend and UI development
- **Web QA** - Web testing and E2E validation

#### Project Management
- **Ticketing** - Issue tracking and management
- **Project Organizer** - File organization and structure
- **Memory Manager** - Project memory and context management

#### Code Quality
- **Refactoring Engineer** - Code refactoring and optimization
- **Code Analyzer** - Static code analysis with AST and tree-sitter

### Agent Memory System
Agents learn project-specific patterns using a simple list format and can update memories via JSON response fields (`remember` for incremental updates, `MEMORIES` for complete replacement). Initialize with `claude-mpm memory init`.

### MCP Gateway (Model Context Protocol)

Claude MPM includes a powerful MCP Gateway that enables:
- Integration with external tools and services
- Custom tool development
- Protocol-based communication
- Extensible architecture

See [MCP Gateway Documentation](docs/developer/13-mcp-gateway/README.md) for details.

### Memory Management

Large conversation histories can consume 2GB+ of memory. Use the `cleanup-memory` command to manage Claude conversation history:

```bash
# Clean up old conversation history
claude-mpm cleanup-memory

# Keep only recent conversations
claude-mpm cleanup-memory --days 7
```

### Real-Time Monitoring
The `--monitor` flag opens a web dashboard showing live agent activity, file operations, and session management.

See [docs/MEMORY.md](docs/MEMORY.md) and [docs/developer/11-dashboard/README.md](docs/developer/11-dashboard/README.md) for details.
