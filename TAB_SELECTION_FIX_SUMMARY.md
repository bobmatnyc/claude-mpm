# Tab Selection Bug Fix Summary

## Problem
When clicking the "Browser Logs" tab, THREE tabs appeared selected simultaneously:
1. Events (incorrectly selected)
2. File Tree (incorrectly selected)  
3. Browser Logs (correctly selected)

This violated the single-tab selection principle where only ONE tab should be active at a time.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by **multiple conflicting event handlers** for tab switching:

1. **UIStateManager** (`ui-state-manager.js`): The primary tab switching handler
2. **CodeViewer** (`code-viewer.js`): Had its own tab switching logic in the `show()` method
3. **index.html**: Added duplicate click handlers for Browser Logs initialization

These handlers were not coordinating, causing multiple tabs to appear selected.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed UIStateManager (`ui-state-manager.js`)
- Enhanced `switchTab()` method to ensure ALL tabs are properly deselected before selecting new one
- Added debug logging to track tab selection
- Added proper support for 'browser-logs' tab name in `getTabNameFromButton()`
- Integrated Browser Log Viewer initialization directly into tab switching logic

### 2. Fixed CodeViewer (`code-viewer.js`)
- Removed duplicate tab switching logic from `show()` method
- Added new `renderContent()` method for content-only rendering
- Changed `show()` to use internal `_showInternal()` without tab manipulation
- Removed duplicate click event listener for File Tree tab

### 3. Fixed index.html
- Removed duplicate event listeners for Browser Logs tab
- Delegated all tab switching to UIStateManager
- Prevented initialization conflicts

## Technical Details

### Before Fix:
```javascript
// Multiple handlers competing:
// 1. UIStateManager.switchTab()
// 2. CodeViewer.show() manipulating tabs directly
// 3. index.html adding extra listeners
```

### After Fix:
```javascript
// Single source of truth:
// UIStateManager.switchTab() handles ALL tab switching
// Other components only render content when called
```

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Test 1: Click Browser Logs Tab**
- Only Browser Logs tab should be highlighted
- Events and File Tree tabs should NOT be highlighted

✅ **Test 2: Sequential Tab Clicking**
- Click each tab in order
- Verify only clicked tab shows as selected
- Previous tab properly deselected

✅ **Test 3: Rapid Tab Switching**
- Quickly switch between tabs
- No multiple selections should appear
- No race conditions

✅ **Test 4: Tab Content Verification**
- Content matches selected tab
- No content mixing between tabs

## Files Modified

1. `/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/js/components/ui-state-manager.js`
   - Enhanced tab switching logic
   - Added browser-logs support
   - Improved state management

2. `/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/js/components/code-viewer.js`
   - Removed duplicate tab switching
   - Added renderContent() method
   - Removed conflicting event listener

3. `/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/templates/index.html`
   - Removed duplicate event handlers
   - Simplified initialization

## Impact

This fix ensures:
- **Consistent UI behavior**: Only one tab selected at a time
- **Better code organization**: Single source of truth for tab state
- **Improved maintainability**: Centralized tab management
- **No visual glitches**: Clean tab transitions

## Verification

To verify the fix:
1. Open dashboard at `http://localhost:8765`
2. Click Browser Logs tab
3. Confirm only Browser Logs is highlighted
4. Test all other tabs for proper exclusive selection

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always use UIStateManager for tab switching
2. Components should only render content, not manipulate tabs
3. Avoid duplicate event listeners
4. Test tab interactions when adding new tabs
