Date: 2025-10-30
================================================================================

OVERALL STATUS: ⚠️  PARTIAL PASS - Core functionality works, tests need fixing

QUICK STATS:
✅ 20/20 bundled skills have version 0.1.0
✅ 14/14 frontmatter tests passing
⚠️  11/26 VersionService tests passing (15 failing due to test bugs)
✅ /mpm-version command properly documented
✅ All core VersionService methods working correctly

CRITICAL ISSUE:
❌ 15 VersionService unit tests call methods on self instead of service fixture
   → Impact: CI/CD failures, but functionality is correct
   → Fix time: 30-45 minutes
   → Location: tests/services/test_version_service.py lines 23-184

FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION:
✅ Skills version tracking fully operational
✅ SkillRegistry parses frontmatter correctly  
✅ Backward compatibility maintained
✅ VersionService methods return accurate data
✅ Startup logging clean (no skill spam at INFO level)
✅ Pytest output clean by default
✅ HTML reports generate successfully

PASSING TESTS:
- All 14 frontmatter parsing tests ✅
- All 11 VersionService integration tests ✅
  (agents, skills, summary methods)

FAILING TESTS:
- 15 VersionService unit tests ❌
  (version detection, build number, formatting)
  → Cause: Tests call self.method() instead of service.method()

RECOMMENDATION:
HOLD for production until tests fixed
APPROVED for manual testing and integration
