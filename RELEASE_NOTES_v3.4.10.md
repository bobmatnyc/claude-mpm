# Claude MPM v3.4.10 Release Notes

**Release Date**: August 7, 2025  
**Release Type**: Patch Release  

## Overview

This patch release resolves a critical dependency installation issue that prevented Socket.IO monitoring features from working properly on macOS systems using pipx installations.

## üêõ Critical Bug Fix

### Socket.IO Dependencies Now Core Requirements

**Issue**: Users on macOS using `pipx install claude-mpm` encountered an "externally-managed-environment" error when the system tried to install optional Socket.IO dependencies for monitoring features.

**Root Cause**: Socket.IO dependencies (python-socketio, aiohttp, python-engineio) were listed as optional dependencies in the [project.optional-dependencies] monitor group, causing them to not be installed automatically with the main package.

**Resolution**: Moved all Socket.IO dependencies from optional to required dependencies in the main dependency list.

## üì¶ Changes Made

### Dependencies Updated
- **python-socketio** ‚â•5.0.0: Moved from optional to required
- **aiohttp** ‚â•3.8.0: Moved from optional to required  
- **python-engineio** ‚â•4.0.0: Moved from optional to required

### Files Modified
- `pyproject.toml`: Dependency reorganization
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Updated with detailed fix information
- `package.json`: Version synchronization
- `VERSION`: Bumped to 3.4.10

## üéØ Impact

### Before This Fix
```bash
pipx install claude-mpm
claude-mpm monitor  # ‚ùå Failed with dependency errors
```

### After This Fix
```bash
pipx install claude-mpm
claude-mpm monitor  # ‚úÖ Works immediately
```

## ‚úÖ Benefits

1. **Out-of-the-box monitoring**: Socket.IO monitoring works immediately after installation
2. **pipx compatibility**: No more externally-managed-environment errors on macOS
3. **Simplified installation**: No need to manually install optional dependencies
4. **Better user experience**: Monitoring features are always available
