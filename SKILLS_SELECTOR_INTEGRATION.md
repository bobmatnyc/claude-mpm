# Skills Selector Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive skills selector to the CLI configurator, integrates runtime skills discovery, and enables automatic skill-to-agent linking.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Skills Selector in CLI Configurator

**Location:** `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm/src/claude_mpm/cli/interactive/skills_wizard.py`

The skills wizard provides an interactive interface for:
- Viewing all available skills (bundled, user, and project)
- Configuring skills for specific agents
- Auto-linking skills to agents based on agent type
- Customizing skill selections per agent

**Access:** Via `claude-mpm configure` → Option 2: Skills Management

#### Main Menu Options:
1. **View Available Skills** - Lists all bundled, user, and project skills with descriptions
2. **Configure Skills for Agents** - Interactive skill selection for enabled agents
3. **View Current Skill Mappings** - Shows which skills are assigned to which agents
4. **Auto-Link Skills to Agents** - Automatically assigns skills based on agent types

### 2. Auto-Linking Logic

**Mappings Implemented:**

- **Engineer Core Skills:** test-driven-development, systematic-debugging, code-review, refactoring-patterns, git-workflow
- **Python Engineer:** Core skills + async-testing
- **TypeScript Engineer:** Core skills + async-testing
- **React Engineer:** TypeScript skills + performance-profiling
- **Next.js Engineer:** React skills
- **Golang Engineer:** Core skills + async-testing
- **Ops Agents:** docker-containerization, database-migration, security-scanning, systematic-debugging
- **QA Agents:** test-driven-development, systematic-debugging, async-testing, performance-profiling
- **Documentation Agents:** api-documentation, code-review

### 3. Runtime Skills Discovery

**Location:** `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm/src/claude_mpm/cli/startup.py`

Runtime discovery automatically:
- Scans `.claude/skills/` directories (user and project levels)
- Infers which agents should have each skill based on content/naming
- Links discovered skills to appropriate agents at startup

**Inference Logic:**
- Python keywords → python-engineer
- TypeScript/JavaScript keywords → typescript/react/nextjs engineers
- Docker/Kubernetes keywords → ops agents
- Testing keywords → qa agents
- Documentation keywords → documentation agents

### 4. Skills Configuration Persistence

**Location:** `.claude-mpm/skills_config.json`

Skill mappings are automatically saved and loaded from this JSON file, allowing persistent configuration across sessions.

## Files Modified

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Skills Selector in Configurator

```bash
# Run the configurator
claude-mpm configure

# Navigate through the menu:
# 1. Select option [1] - Agent Management
#    - Enable some agents (e.g., python-engineer, qa)
#    - Press 's' to save, 'b' to go back
#
# 2. Select option [2] - Skills Management
#    - Try option [1] to view available skills
#    - Try option [4] to auto-link skills
#    - Try option [3] to view current mappings
```

Expected Results:
- ✅ Skills Management menu appears with 4 options
- ✅ Available skills are listed with descriptions
- ✅ Auto-linking creates appropriate mappings
- ✅ Mappings are displayed in a formatted table

### Test 2: Runtime Skills Discovery

```bash
# Create a test skill in project directory
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cat > .claude/skills/custom-python-skill.md << 'EOF'
# Custom Python Testing Skill

This is a custom skill for Python testing workflows.
It includes pytest patterns and Python-specific test utilities.
EOF

# Restart claude-mpm to trigger discovery
claude-mpm run

# Check if skill was discovered (look in logs)
```

Expected Results:
- ✅ Skill is automatically discovered at startup
- ✅ Skill is linked to python-engineer (due to "Python" in content)
- ✅ No errors in startup logs

### Test 3: Configuration Persistence

```bash
# Configure skills via configurator
claude-mpm configure
# Select option 2 (Skills Management)
# Select option 4 (Auto-Link Skills)
# Confirm and save

# Check if config file was created
cat .claude-mpm/skills_config.json

# Restart and verify mappings persist
claude-mpm configure
# Select option 2 (Skills Management)
# Select option 3 (View Current Skill Mappings)
```

Expected Results:
- ✅ `skills_config.json` is created with correct mappings
- ✅ Mappings persist across restarts
- ✅ Viewing mappings shows previously configured skills

### Test 4: Custom Skills Selection

```bash
# Run configurator
claude-mpm configure

# Select option 2 (Skills Management)
# Select option 2 (Configure Skills for Agents)
# Choose to customize selections
# Select specific skill numbers (e.g., 1,3,5)
# Confirm changes
```

Expected Results:
- ✅ Only selected skills are assigned to agents
- ✅ Changes are saved to config file
- ✅ Custom selections persist

### Test 5: Skills Integration with Agents

```bash
# Enable an agent with skills
claude-mpm configure
# Enable python-engineer with auto-linked skills

# Run MPM and delegate to that agent
# Check agent prompt for skills section
```

Expected Results:
- ✅ Agent receives skills in enhanced prompt
- ✅ Skills content is injected into agent context
- ✅ Agent can reference skills during execution

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Singleton Pattern for Registry and Manager?
- Ensures consistent state across all components
- Prevents duplicate skill loading
- Simplifies access patterns

### Why Auto-Linking at Install?
- Reduces manual configuration burden
- Provides intelligent defaults
- Users can still customize after auto-linking

### Why Runtime Discovery?
- Allows hot-reloading of new skills
- Supports project-specific skill customization
- No need to restart for user-added skills

### Why JSON Configuration?
- Human-readable and editable
- Easy to version control
- Simple to parse and modify programmatically

## Potential Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Circular Import
**Symptom:** ImportError when importing skills_wizard in startup.py

**Solution:** Use lazy imports inside the `discover_and_link_runtime_skills()` function rather than at module level.

### Issue 2: Skills Not Appearing
**Symptom:** Bundled skills not showing in wizard

**Solution:**
- Check that `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm/src/claude_mpm/skills/bundled/` contains .md files
- Verify registry initialization in startup
- Check logger output for loading errors

### Issue 3: Mappings Not Persisting
**Symptom:** Skill mappings lost after restart

**Solution:**
- Ensure `.claude-mpm` directory exists
- Check write permissions on skills_config.json
- Verify `save_mappings_to_config()` is called after changes

### Issue 4: Runtime Discovery Not Working
**Symptom:** Skills in .claude/skills/ not discovered

**Solution:**
- Verify `discover_and_link_runtime_skills()` is called in startup
- Check that skills have .md extension
- Verify directory structure (.claude/skills/ at project or user level)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Skill Dependencies**
   - Allow skills to declare dependencies on other skills
   - Auto-include dependent skills when parent is selected

2. **Skill Tags and Categories**
   - Add formal tagging system for better organization
   - Filter skills by category in wizard

3. **Skill Versioning**
   - Track skill versions for compatibility
   - Allow multiple versions of same skill

4. **Skill Templates**
   - Provide skill templates for common patterns
   - CLI command to generate new skill skeletons

5. **Skill Metrics**
   - Track which skills are most used
   - Recommend skills based on usage patterns

6. **Skill Validation**
   - Validate skill content/format
   - Warn about missing required sections

## LOC Impact

**Net Lines Added:** ~520 lines
- skills_wizard.py: ~480 lines (new file)
- skill_manager.py: ~100 lines (methods added)
- configure.py: ~130 lines (skills management)
- startup.py: ~20 lines (discovery hook)
- Other files: ~10 lines (imports/navigation)

**Code Reuse:**
- Leveraged existing SkillsRegistry (no changes needed, already had reload())
- Used existing Rich console components
- Reused AgentWizard patterns for consistency
- Built on existing configure command structure

**Consolidation Opportunities:**
- Could extract common wizard patterns into shared base class
- Skill inference logic could be data-driven (YAML/JSON config)
- Menu rendering could be further abstracted

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully adds comprehensive skills management to claude-mpm with:
- ✅ Interactive skills selector in CLI configurator
- ✅ Automatic skill-to-agent linking at install time
- ✅ Runtime skills discovery from .claude/skills/
- ✅ Configuration persistence
- ✅ Intelligent auto-linking based on agent types
- ✅ Support for bundled, user, and project skills

The implementation follows existing patterns, maintains clean separation of concerns, and provides a solid foundation for future skill-related features.
