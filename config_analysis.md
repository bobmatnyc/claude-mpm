# Configuration Analysis Report

## Current State

The project currently has **THREE** configuration files defining dependencies:

1. `pyproject.toml` - Modern Python packaging standard
2. `setup.py` - Legacy setuptools configuration  
3. `requirements.txt` - Traditional pip requirements

## Dependency Comparison

### Dependencies ONLY in pyproject.toml:
- `tree-sitter>=0.21.0`
- `python-socketio>=5.11.0` 
- `aiohttp>=3.9.0`
- `aiohttp-cors>=0.7.0,<0.8.0`
- `python-engineio>=4.8.0`
- `aiofiles>=23.0.0`
- `mcp>=0.1.0`
- `ijson>=3.2.0`
- `importlib-resources>=5.0; python_version < '3.9'`

### Dependencies ONLY in setup.py/requirements.txt:
- `websockets>=12.0` (in both setup.py fallback and requirements.txt)
- `toml>=0.10.2` (in both setup.py fallback and requirements.txt)
- `packaging>=21.0` (in both setup.py fallback and requirements.txt)
- `pydantic>=2.0.0` (requirements.txt only)
- `pydantic-settings>=2.0.0` (requirements.txt only)
- `mypy>=1.0.0` (requirements.txt only - should be dev dependency)
- `types-PyYAML>=6.0.0` (requirements.txt only - should be dev dependency)
- `types-requests>=2.25.0` (requirements.txt only - should be dev dependency)

### Common Dependencies:
- `ai-trackdown-pytools>=1.4.0`
- `pyyaml>=6.0`
- `python-dotenv>=0.19.0`
- `click>=8.0.0`
- `pexpect>=4.8.0`
- `psutil>=5.9.0`
- `requests>=2.25.0`
- `flask>=3.0.0`
- `flask-cors>=4.0.0`
- `watchdog>=3.0.0`
- `python-frontmatter>=1.0.0`
- `mistune>=3.0.0`

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Dependency Drift**
- pyproject.toml has newer async/MCP dependencies
- setup.py/requirements.txt have older sync dependencies
- Some dependencies are missing from pyproject.toml

### 2. **Inconsistent Versioning**
- Different version constraints in different files
- No single source of truth

### 3. **Mixed Development Dependencies**
- Some dev dependencies in requirements.txt should be in pyproject.toml [project.optional-dependencies.dev]

### 4. **Complex Fallback Logic**
- setup.py reads from requirements.txt OR uses hardcoded fallback
- This creates potential for inconsistency

## Recommended Migration Strategy

1. **Consolidate all dependencies in pyproject.toml**
2. **Remove setup.py entirely** 
3. **Remove requirements.txt**
4. **Use modern build backend** (setuptools with pyproject.toml)
5. **Properly categorize dev dependencies**

## Migration Results ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

1. **‚úÖ Updated pyproject.toml with missing dependencies**
   - Added all dependencies from setup.py and requirements.txt
   - Organized dependencies with clear comments
   - Added missing dependencies: websockets, toml, packaging, pydantic, pydantic-settings

2. **‚úÖ Moved dev dependencies to proper section**
   - Consolidated type checking dependencies (mypy, types-PyYAML, types-requests)
   - Organized dev dependencies in both [project.optional-dependencies.dev] and [tool.uv.dev-dependencies]

3. **‚úÖ Removed setup.py and requirements.txt**
   - Created backups (setup.py.backup, requirements.txt.backup)
   - Removed original files to eliminate configuration drift

4. **‚úÖ Created post-install script**
   - Extracted custom installation logic from setup.py into scripts/post_install.py
   - Handles directory creation, dashboard building, ticket command installation

5. **‚úÖ Fixed configuration issues**
   - Fixed license field format (was [project.license], now license = "MIT")
   - Added proper author and maintainer information
   - Added project URLs (homepage, repository, issues, documentation)

6. **‚úÖ Tested build and installation**
   - Successfully built wheel with `python -m build --wheel`
   - Post-install script runs successfully
   - No more configuration file conflicts

### üéØ Benefits Achieved

- **Single source of truth**: All configuration now in pyproject.toml
- **Modern packaging**: Using PEP 621 standard
- **Reduced maintenance**: No more sync issues between multiple config files
- **Cleaner builds**: No more warnings about conflicting configuration
- **Better organization**: Dependencies properly categorized

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues to Address Later

1. **Dynamic version**: Version shows as 0.0.0 (pbr version loading needs adjustment)
2. **Dashboard build warnings**: Vite build has some JS syntax issues
3. **MANIFEST.in cleanup**: Some file patterns reference removed files

### üìã Next Recommended Steps

1. Fix dynamic version loading (investigate pbr configuration)
2. Clean up MANIFEST.in to remove references to deleted files
3. Address dashboard build warnings
4. Update documentation to reflect new installation process
