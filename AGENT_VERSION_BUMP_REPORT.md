## Notable Observations

### Special Cases
- **local-ops-agent**: Started at version 2.0.1 (higher than others) and was bumped to 2.0.2
- All other agents: Started at 1.0.0 and bumped to 1.0.1

### File Naming Conventions
The agent files use mixed naming conventions:
- **Hyphens**: `agent-manager.json`, `ruby-engineer.json`, `php-engineer.json`
- **Underscores**: `python_engineer.json`, `code_analyzer.json`, `api_qa.json`
- **Plain names**: `documentation.json`, `engineer.json`, `ops.json`

## Verification Results

### Sample Verification
Manual verification of key agents confirms successful version bumps:

```bash
# engineer.json
"version": "1.0.1"  ✓

# python_engineer.json
"version": "1.0.1"  ✓

# qa.json
"version": "1.0.1"  ✓

# ruby-engineer.json
"version": "1.0.1"  ✓

# local_ops_agent.json
"version": "2.0.2"  ✓
```

### JSON Validation
All 31 JSON files validated successfully:
- Valid JSON syntax
- Version field present
- Proper formatting preserved

## Technical Details

### Version Bump Logic
```python
def bump_patch_version(version_str):
    """Bump patch version (3.0.0 → 3.0.1)."""
    parts = version_str.split('.')
    if len(parts) == 3:
        major, minor, patch = parts
        new_patch = str(int(patch) + 1)
        return f"{major}.{minor}.{new_patch}"
    return version_str
```

### Agents Directory
```
/Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm/src/claude_mpm/agents/templates/
```

### Version Format
Follows Semantic Versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- MAJOR: Breaking changes
- MINOR: New features (backward compatible)
- PATCH: Bug fixes and minor updates
