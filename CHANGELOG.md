### üìã Migration Guide

To upgrade from 3.7.x to 3.8.0:

1. **Update import paths** for services:
   ```python
   # Old
   from claude_mpm.services.agent_registry import AgentRegistry
   
   # New
   from claude_mpm.services.agents.agent_registry import AgentRegistry
   ```

2. **Update configuration files** to new format:
   ```yaml
   # Old format
   timeout: 30
   
   # New format
   timeouts:
     default: 30
     agent_deployment: 60
   ```

3. **Review breaking changes** in service interfaces
4. **Run tests** to ensure compatibility
5. **Update any custom services** to use new DI patterns
