# 5-Minute Quick Start

Get Claude MPM running in 5 minutes or less!

## 1. Install (30 seconds)

```bash
# Quick install
pip install claude-mpm
```

**Requirements**: Python 3.8+, Claude Code

## 2. Start Claude MPM (10 seconds)

```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended for first time)
claude-mpm
```

This opens a Claude session with multi-agent orchestration enabled.

## 3. Try Your First Task (2 minutes)

Type any of these commands:

```bash
# In interactive mode:
"Analyze this project structure"
"Help me improve this code"
"Create tests for this function"
```

Watch as specialized agents (Research, Engineer, QA) work together!

## 4. Claude Code Slash Commands (2 minutes)

Claude MPM adds powerful slash commands to your Claude Code sessions:

```bash
# Project diagnostics and health check
/mpm-doctor

# Initialize project for Claude MPM (run once per project)
/mpm-init

# Manage and deploy agents
/mpm-agents
```

**Use these commands inside any Claude Code session** - they'll work automatically when Claude MPM is installed.

### Monitor Real-Time Activity
```bash
claude-mpm run --monitor
```
Opens dashboard at http://localhost:8765 showing agent activity.

## What Just Happened?

✅ **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: PM agent automatically delegates to specialists:  
   Research → Engineer → QA → Documentation

✅ **Session Persistence**: Everything saved, resume anytime

✅ **Project Learning**: Agents remember your patterns and preferences

✅ **Real-Time Monitoring**: See agent collaboration live

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Interactive (recommended)
claude-mpm

# With monitoring dashboard
claude-mpm run --monitor

# One-time task
claude-mpm run -i "your task" --non-interactive

# Resume previous session
/resume
```

## 🎯 You're Ready!

That's it! You now have:
- Multi-agent task delegation
- Persistent sessions
