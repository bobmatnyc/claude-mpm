# Activity Dashboard Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The Activity Dashboard has been successfully implemented with all requested features. It provides a hierarchical, session-based view of PM → Agent → Tool activities with real-time updates.

## 📁 Files Created

1. **`/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/activity.html`**
   - Main activity dashboard HTML file
   - Dark theme consistent with other monitors
   - Gradient headers and modern UI design
   - Integration with existing components

## 🎯 Dashboard Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Hierarchical Tree View**: PM → Agent → Tool activities displayed in tree structure
- ✅ **Session-Based Organization**: Activities grouped by PM sessions
- ✅ **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live event streaming
- ✅ **Activity Tree Component**: Leverages existing `activity-tree.js` component

### Visual Design
- ✅ **Dark Theme**: Consistent with other monitor dashboards
- ✅ **Gradient Headers**: Modern gradient design (green to cyan)
- ✅ **Status Indicators**: Active, complete, error states with visual indicators
- ✅ **Hierarchical Indentation**: Clear visual hierarchy with indentation levels

### User Interface Elements
- ✅ **Connection Status**: Real-time connection indicator with pulse animation
- ✅ **Event Statistics Panel**: Shows total nodes, active items, tree depth, agent count
- ✅ **Controls Panel**: Session filter, time range, search, expand/collapse buttons
- ✅ **Navigation Tabs**: Links to other dashboards (events, agents, tools, files)
- ✅ **Uptime Counter**: Live uptime display

### Tree View Features
- ✅ **Expandable/Collapsible Nodes**: Click to expand/collapse tree sections
- ✅ **Color-Coded Node Types**:
  - Sessions: Gradient background (green to cyan)
  - Agents: Blue border
  - Tools: Yellow border
  - User Instructions: Purple border
  - TodoWrite: Pink border
- ✅ **Status Badges**: Visual status for each node (active, completed, pending)
- ✅ **Icon System**: Unique icons for different entity types

## 🌐 Access Instructions

1. **Start the Monitor Server**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/claude-mpm --use-venv monitor start
   ```

2. **Access the Dashboard**:
   - Open: http://localhost:8765/static/activity.html
   - The dashboard will automatically connect via WebSocket
   - Activities will appear in real-time as they occur

3. **Navigation to Other Dashboards**:
   - Events: http://localhost:8765/static/events.html
   - Agents: http://localhost:8765/static/agents.html
   - Tools: http://localhost:8765/static/tools.html
   - Files: http://localhost:8765/static/files.html

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Component Integration
- Uses existing `ActivityTree` class from `/static/built/components/activity-tree.js`
- Integrates with `SocketClient` for WebSocket communication
- Leverages `SessionManager` for session filtering
- Utilizes `UnifiedDataViewer` for consistent data display

### Data Flow
1. Events received via WebSocket from monitor server
2. ActivityTree component processes events into hierarchical structure
3. Tree view renders with proper parent-child relationships
4. Real-time updates apply without full re-render

### Event Processing
- Supports all event types: Start, SubagentStart, SubagentStop, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, TodoWrite
- Maintains session state and agent hierarchy
- Tracks tool execution status and results
- Preserves user instructions and context

## 📊 Features from Legacy Dashboard

All features from the legacy `claude_mpm_monitor.html` have been preserved:

- ✅ Connection status with visual indicators
- ✅ Event statistics and counters
- ✅ Hierarchical activity tree
- ✅ Session-based organization
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ✅ Expandable/collapsible tree nodes
- ✅ Search and filtering capabilities
- ✅ Time range selection

## 🎨 Visual Enhancements

The new dashboard includes modern visual improvements:

- Glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur
- Gradient backgrounds and borders
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes
- Dark theme optimized for developer workflows
- Color-coded elements for quick visual parsing

## 🚀 Testing Verification

The dashboard has been verified to:
1. Load successfully when accessing http://localhost:8765/static/activity.html
2. Display the correct HTML structure and styling
3. Include all navigation links to other dashboards
4. Integrate properly with the ActivityTree component
5. Show empty state when no activities are present
6. Be ready to receive and display real-time events

## 📝 Usage Example

When PM activities occur, the dashboard displays them hierarchically:

```
🎯 PM Session (timestamp)
  └─ 💬 User: "Build a web application..."
  └─ 📝 TodoWrite (4 tasks)
      ├─ ✅ Design database schema
      ├─ 🔄 Implement user model
      └─ ⏳ Create authentication endpoints
  └─ 📊 PM
      └─ 👷 Engineer
          ├─ 👁️ Read: /project/requirements.txt
          ├─ ✍️ Write: /project/models/user.py
          └─ 💻 Bash: python manage.py migrate
      └─ 🧪 QA
          └─ 💻 Bash: npm test --coverage
```

## ✨ Summary

The Activity Dashboard is now fully implemented and ready for use. It provides a comprehensive, real-time view of all PM and agent activities with a modern, intuitive interface that matches the design language of the other monitoring dashboards in the Claude MPM system.
