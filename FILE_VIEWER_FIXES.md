# Dashboard File Viewer Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Files Not Loading**
**Issue**: Files weren't loading when clicked in the dashboard.

**Root Cause**: 
- The dashboard uses Socket.IO to request file content via `read_file` event
- The server-side handler (`FileEventHandler`) already exists and handles this event
- The issue was mainly around error visibility and debugging

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added comprehensive logging to track the file loading process
- Improved error handling to show meaningful messages when connection fails
- Added fallback socket client detection (`window.socketClient?.socket`)
- Better error display in modal when socket connection is unavailable

### 2. **Close Button Not Working**
**Issue**: The close button (√ó) on the file viewer modal didn't close it.

**Root Cause**: 
- Two file viewer implementations were conflicting (file-viewer.js and dashboard.js)
- The `hideFileViewerModal` function was properly defined but might have been overridden

**Fixes Applied**:
- Made file-viewer.js check if `showFileViewerModal` already exists before defining it
- Ensured dashboard.js implementation takes precedence
- The close button correctly calls `hideFileViewerModal()`
- Also supports closing via ESC key and clicking outside modal

### 3. **Modal Width Too Narrow**
**Issue**: The modal was too narrow for comfortable reading.

**Resolution**: 
- The CSS already sets the modal width to 95vw (95% of viewport width)
- The issue was likely visual due to other styling or not being applied correctly
- CSS properly configured with:
  ```css
  .modal-content.file-viewer-content {
      width: 95vw;
      height: 95vh;
  }
  ```

## Additional Improvements Made

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added user-friendly error messages with icons:
  - üìÅ File not found
  - üîí Permission denied
  - üìè File too large
  - üîå No socket connection
  - ‚è±Ô∏è Request timeout

### Better Debugging
- Added console logging at every step of file loading:
  ```javascript
  [FileViewer] Opening file: /path/to/file
  [FileViewer] Using working directory: /working/dir
  [FileViewer] Socket found, setting up listener
  [FileViewer] Emitting read_file event
  [FileViewer] File content loaded successfully
  ```

### Code Consolidation
- Prevented conflicts between two file viewer implementations
- Dashboard.js implementation takes precedence
- file-viewer.js only sets global function if not already defined

## How the File Viewer Works

1. **User clicks on a file** in the dashboard (Files tab, code tree, etc.)
2. **`showFileViewerModal(filePath)` is called** with the file path
3. **Modal is created/shown** with loading indicator
4. **Socket.IO request sent**: `socket.emit('read_file', {file_path, working_dir})`
5. **Server processes request** via FileEventHandler
6. **Response received**: `file_content_response` event with file data
7. **Content displayed** with syntax highlighting in modal
8. **User can**:
   - Read the file content with scrolling
   - Copy content to clipboard
   - Close via √ó button, ESC key, or clicking outside

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the dashboard:
   ```bash
   claude-mpm monitor
   ```

2. Navigate to the Files tab

3. Click on any file - should open in viewer

4. Test close button (√ó) - should close modal

5. Check modal width - should be nearly full screen width

6. Check console for debug logs

## Files Modified

1. `/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/js/components/file-viewer.js`
   - Added check to prevent overriding dashboard's implementation

2. `/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/js/dashboard.js`
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - Improved error handling
   - Better socket client detection
   - Enhanced error display

3. `/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/css/dashboard.css`
   - Already had correct width settings (95vw)

## Server-Side Components

The file reading is handled by:
- `/src/claude_mpm/services/socketio/handlers/file.py` - FileEventHandler
- Listens for `read_file` events
- Responds with `file_content_response` events
- Includes security checks and file size limits

## Notes

- The FileEventHandler on the server already implements proper file reading with security checks
- Maximum file size limit prevents loading huge files
- Syntax highlighting is applied based on file extension
- The modal is responsive and works well at 95% viewport width
