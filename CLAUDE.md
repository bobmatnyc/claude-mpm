# Project Memory Configuration

This project uses KuzuMemory for intelligent context management.

## Project Information
- **Path**: /Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm
- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: FastAPI

## Memory Integration

KuzuMemory is configured to enhance all AI interactions with project-specific context.

### Available Commands:
- `kuzu-memory enhance <prompt>` - Enhance prompts with project context
- `kuzu-memory learn <content>` - Store learning from conversations (async)
- `kuzu-memory recall <query>` - Query project memories
- `kuzu-memory stats` - View memory statistics

### MCP Tools Available:
When interacting with Claude Desktop, the following MCP tools are available:
- **kuzu_enhance**: Enhance prompts with project memories
- **kuzu_learn**: Store new learnings asynchronously
- **kuzu_recall**: Query specific memories
- **kuzu_stats**: Get memory system statistics

## Project Context

Claude Multi-Agent Project Manager - Orchestrate Claude with agent delegation and ticket tracking

## StGit Patch Management

This fork uses [StGit](https://stacked-git.github.io/) for managing local changes as a stack of patches on top of upstream. This enables clean rebasing when upstream releases new versions.

### Branch Structure
- `main` - Production branch (updated from stgit-migration after rebasing)
- `stgit-migration` - StGit-managed branch with patches on upstream/main
- `upstream` - Remote tracking upstream repository (bobmatnyc/claude-mpm)

### Current Patch Stack
```
01-headless-mode-cli-flags       # --headless CLI flag
02-headless-mode-session         # HeadlessSession class
03-headless-mode-integration     # CLI integration + tests
04-headless-mode-docs            # Headless documentation
05-tob-setup-script              # TOB installation script
06-documentation-updates         # README/CLAUDE.md updates
```

Note: Commander Pro UI patches were removed in sync with upstream v5.6.108,
which extracted the commander module to [ai-commander](https://github.com/bobmatnyc/ai-commander).

### Syncing with Upstream

Use `stg pull` for a single-command update, or the staged approach for more control:

```bash
# Switch to stgit branch
git checkout stgit-migration

# Option A: Single command (fetch + rebase)
stg pull

# Option B: Staged approach (more control)
git fetch upstream
stg pop -a                    # Pop all patches
stg rebase upstream/main      # Rebase stack base
stg push -a                   # Reapply patches

# If conflicts occur during push:
# 1. Resolve conflicts in files
# 2. git add <resolved-files>
# 3. stg refresh
# 4. stg push -a              # Continue pushing remaining patches

# Update main branch
git checkout main
git merge stgit-migration
git push origin main
```

### When Patches Are Accepted Upstream

Use `--merged` flag to detect merged patches:

```bash
stg pull --merged
# or
stg rebase --merged upstream/main

# Merged patches become empty. To clean up:
stg series --empty            # Shows empty patches with '0' prefix
stg clean                     # Removes empty patches
```

### Modifying an Existing Patch

```bash
git checkout stgit-migration
stg goto <patch-name>         # Navigate to patch
# Make changes to files
stg refresh                   # Update patch with changes
stg refresh -e                # Update patch + edit commit message
stg push -a                   # Reapply remaining patches
```

### Creating a New Patch

```bash
git checkout stgit-migration
stg new <patch-name> -m "Short description"
# Make changes to files
stg refresh
```

### Useful Commands

```bash
stg series -d                 # List patches with descriptions
stg show <patch>              # Show patch diff
stg pop / stg push            # Navigate stack
stg goto <patch>              # Jump to specific patch
stg clean                     # Remove empty patches
stg commit <patch>            # Permanently commit patch to history
```

### Best Practices

1. **Rebase frequently** - Smaller conflict sets are easier to resolve
2. **Logical patch organization** - One feature/fix per patch
3. **Clear commit messages** - Follow conventional commits format
4. **Test after rebase** - Run `uv run pytest` after pushing patches
