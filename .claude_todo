### TSK-VERIFY-FRAMEWORK-LOADING - Testing Framework Loading in Pipx Installations
**Agent**: QA  
**Status**: READY_FOR_DELEGATION  
**Priority**: High  
**Context**: Recent fix added importlib.resources support for loading INSTRUCTIONS.md in pipx installations  

**Objective**: Verify that the framework instructions load correctly in pipx installations without warnings

**Testing Requirements**:
- Test `./claude-mpm agents` command to verify agents load with proper capabilities
- Verify framework loader can find and load INSTRUCTIONS.md without "Framework not found" warnings
- Test framework loader functionality with different installation methods if possible
- Confirm that agent capabilities are properly displayed
- Validate that PM framework behavior is correctly applied

**Key Changes to Test**:
- `src/claude_mpm/core/framework_loader.py` - Added importlib.resources support

**Expected Outcome**: Framework loads correctly without warnings, agents display full capabilities

**Notes**: This addresses the pipx installation issue where framework instructions couldn't be found
