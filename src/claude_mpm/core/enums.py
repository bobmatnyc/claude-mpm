"""
Centralized enums for type-safe string constants across Claude MPM.

This module provides enumerated types to replace magic strings throughout the codebase,
improving type safety, IDE autocomplete, and preventing typos.

Created: 2025-10-25
Priority: Phase 1 of systematic enum migration (3-4 week plan)
Impact: Replaces 2,050+ magic string occurrences

Usage:
    from claude_mpm.core.enums import OperationResult, OutputFormat, ServiceState

    # Type-safe operation results
    result = OperationResult.SUCCESS
    if result == OperationResult.SUCCESS:
        print("Operation completed successfully")

    # Type-safe output formatting
    format_type = OutputFormat.JSON

    # Type-safe service state management
    state = ServiceState.RUNNING
