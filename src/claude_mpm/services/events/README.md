# Event Bus System

A decoupled, reliable event system for Claude MPM that separates event producers from consumers, enabling better testing, maintenance, and extensibility.

## Overview

The Event Bus system provides a central hub for all events in the Claude MPM framework. Instead of components directly calling Socket.IO or other services, they publish events to the bus, which routes them to interested consumers.

## Architecture

```
Producers → Event Bus → Consumers
```

### Key Components

- **EventBus**: Central routing and queuing system
- **Event**: Standard event format with metadata
- **Producers**: Publish events without knowing consumers
- **Consumers**: Subscribe to topics and process events
- **Topics**: Hierarchical event categorization

## Benefits

### 1. Decoupling
- Producers don't know about consumers
- Socket.IO is just another consumer
- Easy to add/remove consumers without affecting producers

### 2. Reliability
- Events queued when consumers unavailable
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Dead letter queue for failed events
- Graceful degradation

### 3. Testability
- Test producers without Socket.IO
- Mock event bus for unit tests
- Test consumers in isolation
- Deterministic event flow

### 4. Observability
- Central metrics collection
- Event flow monitoring
- Performance tracking
- Debug logging

### 5. Flexibility
- Topic-based filtering
- Event transformation
- Batch processing
- Priority queuing

## Usage

### Basic Setup

```python
from claude_mpm.services.events import EventBus, SocketIOConsumer, LoggingConsumer

# Create and start event bus
bus = EventBus()
await bus.start()

# Add consumers
socketio_consumer = SocketIOConsumer()
await bus.subscribe(socketio_consumer)

logging_consumer = LoggingConsumer(topics=["hook.**"])
await bus.subscribe(logging_consumer)
```

### Publishing Events

```python
from claude_mpm.services.events import HookEventProducer

# Create producer
producer = HookEventProducer(bus)

# Publish events
await producer.publish_response({
    "content": "Assistant response text",
    "model": "claude-3",
})

await producer.publish_tool_use(
    tool_name="Read",
    tool_params={"file_path": "/path/to/file"},
    tool_result="File contents",
)
```

### Creating Custom Consumers

```python
from claude_mpm.services.events import IEventConsumer, ConsumerConfig

class CustomConsumer(IEventConsumer):
    def __init__(self):
        self._config = ConsumerConfig(
            name="CustomConsumer",
            topics=["system.**"],  # Subscribe to system events
            priority=ConsumerPriority.NORMAL,
        )
    
    async def consume(self, event: Event) -> bool:
        # Process event
        print(f"Processing: {event.topic} - {event.type}")
        return True
    
    # Implement other required methods...
```

## Topic Hierarchy

Events are organized in a hierarchical topic structure:

```
hook.*          # Hook system events
  .response     # Assistant responses
  .tool         # Tool usage
  .subagent.*   # Subagent events
  .error        # Hook errors

system.*        # System events
  .lifecycle.*  # Service startup/shutdown
  .health       # Health status
  .config       # Configuration changes
  .performance  # Performance metrics
  .error        # System errors
  .warning      # System warnings

cli.*           # CLI command events
agent.*         # Agent events
build.*         # Build monitoring events
```

### Topic Patterns

- `hook.*` - Matches `hook.response` but not `hook.tool.usage`
- `hook.**` - Matches all hook events including nested
- `**` - Matches all events

## Event Format

```python
@dataclass
class Event:
    id: str                    # Unique event ID
    topic: str                 # Event topic
    type: str                  # Event type
    timestamp: datetime        # Creation time
    source: str               # Event source
    data: Dict[str, Any]      # Event payload
    metadata: EventMetadata   # Processing metadata
    correlation_id: str       # Track related events
    priority: EventPriority   # Processing priority
```

## Configuration

### EventBus Options

```python
EventBus(
    max_queue_size=10000,      # Maximum queued events
    process_interval=0.01,     # Processing frequency
    batch_timeout=0.1,         # Batch wait time
    enable_metrics=True,       # Track metrics
    enable_persistence=False,  # Persist to disk
)
```

### Consumer Configuration

```python
ConsumerConfig(
    name="MyConsumer",
    topics=["hook.**"],           # Topics to subscribe
    priority=ConsumerPriority.HIGH,
    batch_size=10,                # Process in batches
    batch_timeout=0.5,            # Batch wait time
    max_retries=3,                # Retry failed events
    retry_backoff=2.0,            # Backoff multiplier
    filter_func=my_filter,        # Event filter
    transform_func=my_transform,  # Event transformer
)
```

## Migration Guide

### Updating Hook Handler

Before (Direct Socket.IO):
```python
# Old: Direct Socket.IO dependency
socketio_client = socketio.Client()
socketio_client.emit("hook_event", event_data)
```

After (Event Bus):
```python
# New: Publish to event bus
producer = HookEventProducer(event_bus)
await producer.publish_response(response_data)
```

### Testing

Before:
```python
# Hard to test - needs Socket.IO server
def test_hook_handler():
    # Complex setup with Socket.IO
    pass
```

After:
```python
# Easy to test - mock event bus
def test_hook_handler():
    mock_bus = Mock()
    producer = HookEventProducer(mock_bus)
    await producer.publish_response(data)
    mock_bus.publish.assert_called_once()
```

## Performance

- **Publish Latency**: <1ms average
- **Processing Throughput**: 10,000+ events/sec
- **Memory Usage**: ~100 bytes per queued event
- **CPU Overhead**: <5% for typical load

## Best Practices

1. **Use Topics Wisely**: Create logical topic hierarchies
2. **Set Priorities**: Critical events should have higher priority
3. **Handle Errors**: Consumers should handle their own errors
4. **Monitor Metrics**: Track queue size and processing rates
5. **Test in Isolation**: Test producers and consumers separately
6. **Batch When Possible**: Improve efficiency with batching
7. **Clean Shutdown**: Always call `bus.stop()` for graceful shutdown
