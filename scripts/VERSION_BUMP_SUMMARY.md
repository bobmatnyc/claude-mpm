## Notable Version Changes

- **local_ops_agent:** Had a different starting version (2.0.1) and was bumped to 2.0.2
- All other agents started at 1.0.0 and were bumped to 1.0.1

## Implementation Details

### Script Location
`/Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm/scripts/bump_agent_versions.py`

### Agents Directory
`/Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm/src/claude_mpm/agents/templates/`

### File Naming Conventions Discovered
- Most engineers use underscores: `python_engineer.json`
- Some agents use hyphens: `agent-manager.json`, `ruby-engineer.json`
- Files use `.json` extension (not `_agent.json`)

## Validation

Sample verification of version changes:
- engineer.json: ✓ Version 1.0.1 confirmed
- python_engineer.json: ✓ Version 1.0.1 confirmed
- qa.json: ✓ Version 1.0.1 confirmed
- ruby-engineer.json: ✓ Version 1.0.1 confirmed
- local_ops_agent.json: ✓ Version 2.0.2 confirmed

All JSON files remain valid after version bumps.

## Next Steps

1. Commit these version changes with appropriate commit message
2. Update CHANGELOG.md if needed
3. Tag release if this is part of a release process
4. Update documentation referencing agent versions
