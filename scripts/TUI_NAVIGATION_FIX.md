# TUI Navigation Fix - Comprehensive Solution

## Problem
The ListView navigation in the TUI wasn't working - clicking on menu items didn't switch screens.

## Root Causes
1. Missing proper event handler decoration (`@on` decorator)
2. Complex sender/ID checks that could fail
3. No fallback mechanisms for different interaction methods

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Multiple Event Handlers with Fallbacks
The solution implements a multi-layered approach to catch navigation events:

#### Primary Handler: `@on(ListView.Selected, "#nav-list")`
- Decorated with `@on` to properly register the event handler
- Specifically targets the `#nav-list` ListView
- Attempts to get screen name from `event.item.data` first
- Falls back to index-based selection if data not available

#### Index Watcher: `_on_nav_index_changed`
- Watches for changes to the ListView's `index` property
- Provides real-time tracking of navigation changes
- Only switches screens if index actually changes to a different screen

#### Traditional Handler: `on_list_view_selected`
- Method-name based handler as ultimate fallback
- Works even if decorator-based handlers fail
- Uses try/except for robust error handling

#### Highlight Handler: `@on(ListView.Highlighted, "#nav-list")`
- Tracks mouse hover events
- Provides visual feedback during navigation

### 2. Data Attributes on ListItems
Each ListItem now has a `data` attribute containing the screen name:
```python
list_item = ListItem(Label(label_text), id=item_id)
list_item.data = screen_name  # Direct mapping to screen
```

This allows direct screen switching without complex ID mapping.

### 3. Simplified Logic
- Removed complex sender/ID checks
- No filtering by sender - handle all ListView selections
- Direct screen name access via data attributes
- Clear fallback chain: data → index → ID mapping

### 4. Enhanced Feedback
- Logging at each step for debugging
- User notifications when screens switch
- Visual highlighting of selected items

## Key Changes Made

1. **Added `@on` decorator** to ListView.Selected handler
2. **Removed sender filtering** - handle all events from nav-list
3. **Added data attributes** to ListItems for direct screen mapping
4. **Implemented index watcher** as secondary mechanism
5. **Added traditional handler** as final fallback
6. **Simplified event handling logic** - no complex checks
7. **Added comprehensive logging** for debugging

## Testing

Use the verification scripts to test:
```bash
# Quick test
python scripts/verify_tui_navigation.py

# Diagnostic test
python scripts/diagnose_listview_events.py

# Simple navigation test
python scripts/test_tui_navigation.py
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **Mouse Click**: Clicking a menu item immediately switches screens
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys + Enter switches screens
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl+A/T/B/S directly navigate to screens
4. **Visual Feedback**: Selected item is highlighted, notification appears
5. **Reliable**: Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure it always works
