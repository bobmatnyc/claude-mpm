# TUI Navigation Fix Summary

## Problem
The navigation menu in `configure_tui.py` wasn't working - clicking or selecting menu items didn't change the content on the right side.

## Root Cause
The ListView selection events weren't being handled properly due to:
1. Missing proper event handling for ListView.Selected
2. No fallback for cases where item IDs might not be accessible
3. Missing focus management for keyboard navigation

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Event Handler (`on_nav_selected`)
- Added proper item ID checking with `hasattr` guard
- Implemented fallback using ListView index when ID is not available
- Added proper null checks for event.item

### 2. Improved Screen Switching (`switch_screen`)
- Added try-catch error handling
- Added error notifications for debugging
- Ensured proper cleanup of old screens before mounting new ones
- Added visual feedback for active navigation items

### 3. CSS Updates for Navigation
- Fixed selectors to target `ListItem` elements correctly
- Added proper hover and highlight states
- Ensured active state is visually distinct

### 4. Focus Management
- Set initial focus on ListView on mount
- Synchronized ListView selection with keyboard shortcuts
- Updated `action_navigate` to also update ListView index

### 5. Keyboard Navigation Enhancement
- Connected keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+T, etc.) to update ListView selection
- Ensured visual state matches keyboard navigation

## How It Works Now

1. **Mouse Navigation**: Click any item in the left sidebar to switch screens
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: 
   - Use arrow keys to navigate the menu
   - Press Enter to select an item
   - Use Ctrl+A/T/B/S shortcuts for direct navigation
3. **Visual Feedback**: Selected item is highlighted with active state
4. **Error Handling**: Any errors during screen switching are caught and displayed

## Testing

Run the test scripts to verify:
```bash
# Full TUI test
python scripts/test_tui_navigation.py

# Simple ListView test
python scripts/check_tui.py

# Or use the actual command
claude-mpm configure --tui
```

## Code Changes

### File Modified: `src/claude_mpm/cli/commands/configure_tui.py`

1. **Lines 1007-1033**: Enhanced `on_nav_selected` with proper ID checking and index fallback
2. **Lines 1035-1073**: Added error handling to `switch_screen` method  
3. **Lines 1075-1084**: Updated `action_navigate` to sync ListView selection
4. **Lines 761-777**: Fixed CSS selectors for ListView items
5. **Lines 992-1005**: Added focus management in `on_mount`

The navigation now works correctly with both mouse clicks and keyboard navigation!
