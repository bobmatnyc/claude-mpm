# HUD (Heads-Up Display) Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a HUD toggle feature for the Claude MPM dashboard that replaces the lower pane with a dynamic tree visualization using Cytoscape.js.

## Features Implemented

### 1. HUD Toggle Button
- **Location**: Added next to the "Export" button in the dashboard header
- **States**: 
  - Disabled by default with tooltip "Select a session to enable HUD"
  - Enabled only when a session is selected
  - Changes text from "HUD" to "Normal View" when active
  - Visual feedback with green color when active

### 2. Session Requirement Logic
- HUD toggle is disabled until a session is selected
- Automatically disables and exits HUD mode when session is deselected
- Dynamic tooltip updates based on session state
- Integrated with existing session management system

### 3. HUD Visualizer Component
- **File**: `/src/claude_mpm/web/static/js/components/hud-visualizer.js`
- **Technology**: Cytoscape.js with Dagre layout extension
- **Features**:
  - Full-screen visualization replacing the lower pane
  - Interactive node manipulation and highlighting
  - Reset layout and center view controls
  - Responsive design with proper resize handling

### 4. Node Types and Visualization
- **PM (Project Manager)**: Rectangle nodes in green for user prompts and Claude responses
- **Agent**: Ellipse nodes in purple for subagent activities
- **Tool**: Diamond nodes in blue for tool calls
- **Todo**: Triangle nodes in red for TodoWrite events

### 5. Tree Layout and Relationships
- **Hierarchical Layout**: Uses Dagre algorithm for tree-like visualization
- **Smart Relationships**: 
  - Tool calls branch from their invoking agents/PM
  - Subagents branch from PM nodes
  - Todo nodes connect to their creating agents
  - Sequential fallback for unclear relationships

### 6. Real-time Updates
- Listens to socket events for dynamic node addition
- Processes new events and adds them to visualization in real-time
- Maintains existing event processing for normal dashboard mode
- Smooth animations for new node additions

### 7. CSS Integration
- **HUD Mode Class**: `.hud-mode` hides normal view and shows HUD
- **Styling**: Consistent with dashboard theme using gradients and modern design
- **Responsive**: Proper handling of container resizing
- **Controls**: Integrated control buttons for layout management

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
1. `/src/claude_mpm/web/static/js/components/hud-visualizer.js` - Main HUD component
2. `/scripts/test_hud_functionality.py` - Testing script

### Modified Files
1. `/src/claude_mpm/web/templates/index.html` - Added HUD button, container, and Cytoscape.js libraries
2. `/src/claude_mpm/web/static/css/dashboard.css` - Added HUD styling and mode classes
3. `/src/claude_mpm/web/static/js/dashboard.js` - Integrated HUD functionality and state management

## Dependencies Added
- Cytoscape.js (v3.26.0) - Core graph visualization library
- Cytoscape-dagre (v2.5.0) - Hierarchical layout extension
- Dagre (v0.8.5) - Layout algorithm implementation

## Usage Instructions

1. **Start Dashboard**: Use existing dashboard startup methods
2. **Select Session**: Choose a session from the dropdown to enable HUD
3. **Toggle HUD**: Click the "HUD" button to enter HUD mode
4. **Interact**: 
   - Click nodes to highlight connected elements
   - Use "Reset Layout" to reorganize visualization
   - Use "Center View" to fit all nodes in view
5. **Exit HUD**: Click "Normal View" to return to standard dashboard

## Testing

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
python scripts/test_hud_functionality.py
```

This will:
- Start the Socket.IO server
- Open the dashboard in your browser
- Provide step-by-step testing instructions

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Modular Design**: HUD component is self-contained and can be easily extended
2. **Session-Aware**: Respects existing session management and filtering
3. **Performance**: Only processes events when HUD is active
4. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing dashboard infrastructure
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add new node types and relationship patterns

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Relationships**: More sophisticated parent-child detection
2. **Filtering**: Filter nodes by type or session in HUD mode
3. **Export**: Export HUD visualization as image or data
4. **Layouts**: Additional layout algorithms (circular, force-directed, etc.)
5. **Node Details**: Enhanced node information display and interaction

## Technical Notes

- Uses event delegation for memory efficiency
- Implements proper cleanup when switching modes
- Handles container resizing gracefully
- Maintains performance with large event datasets
- Compatible with existing keyboard navigation and selection systems
