# Memory System Fix: Project-Only Storage

## Overview
Fixed the memory system to use project-only storage for ALL agents, including PM. Previously, the system incorrectly routed PM memories to the user-level directory (`~/.claude-mpm/memories/`). Now all memories are consistently stored in the project directory (`./.claude-mpm/memories/`).

## Changes Made

### 1. `agent_memory_manager.py`
- **Removed**: User directory initialization and routing logic
- **Removed**: Special case handling for PM agent
- **Removed**: `_ensure_user_memories_directory()` method
- **Removed**: `_aggregate_agent_memories()` method (no longer needed)
- **Simplified**: All agents now use the same project directory path
- **Updated**: `load_agent_memory()` to only check project directory
- **Updated**: `_save_memory_file()` to always save to project directory
- **Updated**: `_create_default_memory()` to always use project directory
- **Updated**: Migration logic to treat all agents equally

### 2. Key Behavioral Changes
- **Before**: PM memories saved to `~/.claude-mpm/memories/PM_memories.md`
- **After**: PM memories saved to `./.claude-mpm/memories/PM_memories.md`
- **Before**: Complex aggregation logic for merging user and project memories
- **After**: Simple project-only storage with backward-compatible reading

## Backward Compatibility
- The system can still READ from user-level directory if files exist there
- The framework_loader.py still aggregates memories from both locations for reading
- All NEW writes go to project directory only
- Migration logic preserves existing memories when converting to new format

## Testing
Comprehensive tests verify:
1. All agents (including PM) save to project directory
2. Memory updates work correctly for all agents
3. Memory extraction saves to project directory
4. Old format files are migrated correctly
5. Size limits are enforced
6. No new user directory files created

## Benefits
1. **Consistency**: All agents follow the same storage pattern
2. **Simplicity**: Removed complex aggregation and routing logic
3. **Project Isolation**: Each project has its own complete set of memories
4. **Version Control**: All memories can be committed with the project
5. **Predictability**: Developers know exactly where memories are stored

## Migration Guide
For existing projects:
1. Any existing user-level PM memories will still be read (backward compatibility)
2. New PM memories will be saved to project directory
3. Over time, user-level memories can be manually moved to project if desired
4. No action required - the system handles everything automatically

## Implementation Details

### Storage Location
All agent memories are stored in:
```
./.claude-mpm/memories/{agent_id}_memories.md
```

### File Naming Convention
- Pattern: `{agent_id}_memories.md`
- Examples: `PM_memories.md`, `engineer_memories.md`, `research_memories.md`

### Memory File Structure
Each memory file follows the same markdown structure with sections for:
- Project Architecture
- Implementation Guidelines
- Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Current Technical Context
- Coding Patterns Learned
- Effective Strategies
- Integration Points
- Performance Considerations
- Domain-Specific Knowledge
- Recent Learnings

## Future Considerations
If user-level memories are needed in the future, they should be:
1. Explicitly opt-in via configuration
2. Used only for truly global, cross-project knowledge
3. Clearly documented as to when they apply
4. Never mixed with project-specific memories in the same file
