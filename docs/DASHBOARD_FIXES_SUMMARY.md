# Dashboard Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Full-Screen Layout Issue
**Problem:** The Events dashboard and other views were not using the full viewport. They had max-width constraints (1400px/1600px) that limited the display area.

**Solution:** Updated all 5 dashboard HTML files to use full viewport:
- Changed `body` to use `width: 100vw; height: 100vh` with flexbox layout
- Removed `max-width` constraints from `.container` elements
- Made containers use `width: 100%; height: 100%` with proper overflow handling
- Made content panels use flexbox with `flex: 1` for proper space distribution

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/events.html`
- `/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/activity.html`
- `/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/agents.html`
- `/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/files.html`
- `/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/monitors.html`

### 2. Activity Tree Not Showing Data
**Problem:** The ActivityTree component was not displaying any data even when events were being received.

**Root Causes:**
1. The ActivityTree was only listening to aggregated events from socketClient, not the raw `claude_event` stream
2. The event type detection was too restrictive and didn't handle all event format variations
3. Events from the server had different structures (nested in `original_event`, different type/subtype formats)

**Solution:**
1. **Added Direct Socket Listener:** Added a direct `socket.on('claude_event')` listener in ActivityTree to ensure all events are received immediately
2. **Improved Event Type Detection:** Enhanced the `getEventType()` method to handle multiple event formats:
   - Check `original_event.type` field
   - Check `data.type` field
   - Handle both snake_case and PascalCase event types
   - Added direct type matching for common events
   - Added debug logging for unrecognized events

**Code Changes:**
- Added direct socket listener in `subscribeToEvents()` method
- Enhanced `getEventType()` method with multiple fallback checks
- Added automatic session creation when events arrive without existing session

**File Modified:**
- `/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/built/components/activity-tree.js`

## Testing

Created a test script (`/scripts/test_dashboard_fixes.py`) that:
1. Connects to the monitor server
2. Sends a complete sequence of events:
   - Session start
   - User prompt
   - SubagentStart/Stop
   - TodoWrite
   - PreToolUse/PostToolUse
3. Verifies the dashboards display correctly

## Verification Steps

To verify the fixes work:

1. **Start the monitor server:**
   ```bash
   claude-mpm monitor start
   ```

2. **Open the dashboards in a browser:**
   - http://localhost:8765 (main dashboard)
   - Navigate through all 5 tabs: Events, Activity, Agents, Files, Monitors

3. **Run the test script:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_dashboard_fixes.py
   ```

4. **Check the following:**
   - ✅ All dashboards use full viewport (no horizontal constraints)
   - ✅ Events dashboard shows all test events
   - ✅ Activity dashboard displays hierarchical tree with:
     - Session nodes
     - User instructions
     - Agent activities
     - Tool usage
     - Todo items
   - ✅ All views are properly full-screen

## Key Improvements

1. **Consistent Full-Screen Layout:** All dashboard views now use the entire browser viewport
2. **Reliable Event Processing:** ActivityTree now receives and processes all events correctly
3. **Flexible Event Handling:** Supports multiple event format variations from different sources
4. **Better Debugging:** Added console logging for unrecognized events to aid troubleshooting

## Technical Details

### CSS Changes for Full-Screen
```css
/* Before */
body {
    min-height: 100vh;
    padding: 20px;
}
.container {
    max-width: 1400px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

/* After */
body {
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
    overflow: hidden;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}
.container {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    padding: 20px;
    overflow-y: auto;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}
```

### JavaScript Event Handling Enhancement
```javascript
// Added direct socket listener
window.socketClient.socket.on('claude_event', (data) => {
    // Process event immediately
    this.processEvent(data);
    this.renderTreeDebounced();
});

// Enhanced event type detection with multiple fallbacks
getEventType(event) {
    // Check multiple possible locations for event type
    if (event.hook_event_name) return event.hook_event_name;
    if (event.original_event?.type) return mapType(event.original_event.type);
    if (event.data?.type) return mapType(event.data.type);
    // ... additional fallbacks
}
```

## Result

Both issues have been successfully resolved:
- ✅ All dashboard views now use full viewport (100vw x 100vh)
- ✅ Activity tree properly receives and displays hierarchical event data
- ✅ Consistent full-screen experience across all 5 dashboard views
- ✅ Reliable event processing with proper type detection
