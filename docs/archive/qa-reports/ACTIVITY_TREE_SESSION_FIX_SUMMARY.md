# Activity Tree Session Fix Summary

**Date**: August 29, 2025  
**Issue**: Activity Tree was building its own sessions from events instead of using the authoritative session data source  
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Validated and tested

## Problem Description

The Activity view was showing different/incorrect sessions compared to the Events view dropdown because:

1. **Activity Tree** was creating its own sessions from individual events using a custom `getSessionId()` method that grouped events by time
2. **Events View** was using the authoritative sessions data from the SocketClient 
3. This caused inconsistency where the two views showed different session lists

## Root Cause

```javascript
// ❌ OLD CODE - Activity Tree built its own sessions
window.socketClient.onEventUpdate((events) => {
    // Only received events, missing sessions parameter
    // Built sessions from scratch using getSessionId()
});
```

The Activity Tree was only receiving the `events` parameter in its `onEventUpdate` callback and missing the `sessions` parameter that contains the authoritative session data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Event Callback Signature
```javascript
// ✅ NEW CODE - Now receives both events AND sessions
window.socketClient.onEventUpdate((events, sessions) => {
    // Use authoritative sessions instead of building from events
    this.sessions.clear();
    for (const [sessionId, sessionData] of sessions.entries()) {
        // Convert to Activity Tree format
    }
});
```

### 2. Removed Custom Session ID Generation
- Removed the `getSessionId()` method that was creating time-based session groupings
- Now uses actual `session_id` from events directly: `event.session_id || event.data?.session_id`
- Events without valid session IDs are skipped with proper logging

### 3. Updated Session Filter Dropdown  
```javascript
// Use same data source as Events view
const socketSessions = window.socketClient?.getState()?.sessions;
// Format sessions to match Events view display exactly
option.textContent = `${dirDisplay} | ${shortId}...${isActive ? ' [ACTIVE]' : ''}`;
```

### 4. Fixed Initial Data Loading
```javascript
// Load from socket client state instead of individual events
const socketState = window.socketClient?.getState();
if (socketState && socketState.events.length > 0) {
    // Initialize sessions from authoritative source
    for (const [sessionId, sessionData] of socketState.sessions.entries()) {
        // Convert and store
    }
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **`/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/js/components/activity-tree.js`**
   - Updated `subscribeToEvents()` method
   - Fixed `onEventUpdate` callback signature  
   - Removed `getSessionId()` method
   - Updated `processEvent()` to use authoritative session IDs
   - Modified `updateSessionFilterDropdown()` to use socket client data
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

2. **Built files updated via `npm run build:dashboard`**
   - `/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/dist/components/activity-tree.js`
   - `/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/built/components/activity-tree.js`

## Validation Results

✅ **Source Code Tests**: 6/6 passed
- onEventUpdate callback receives both events and sessions
- Sessions cleared and rebuilt from authoritative source  
- Custom getSessionId method removed
- Events without session_id properly skipped
- Session filter dropdown uses socket client data
- Initial data loading uses socket client state

✅ **Built Files**: Updated with latest changes
- Minified code contains the fix (verified with grep)
- Both dist and built directories updated

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Consistent Session Lists**: Activity and Events view dropdowns show identical sessions
2. **Correct Session Format**: Sessions display as `working_directory | session_id... [ACTIVE]`
3. **Proper Session Counts**: Agent, instruction, and todo counts are accurate
4. **Session Synchronization**: Both views stay synchronized when sessions are updated

## Testing

### Automated Validation
```bash
python validate_activity_fix.py  # All tests pass
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. Open dashboard at `http://localhost:8765`
2. Compare Activity and Events view session dropdowns
3. Verify identical session lists and format
4. Test session filtering in Activity view
5. Check browser console for proper logging

## Impact

- **User Experience**: Both Activity and Events views now show consistent session information
- **Data Integrity**: Activity Tree uses the same authoritative data source as other components  
- **Maintainability**: Reduced code duplication by using shared session management
- **Performance**: More efficient session handling without redundant session creation

## Technical Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- Session expansion state is preserved during updates  
- Working directory detection follows the same logic as Events view
- Enhanced logging helps with debugging session issues
- Error handling prevents crashes when session data is missing
