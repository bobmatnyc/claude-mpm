# Archive Documentation

This directory contains deprecated or historical documentation that is kept for reference purposes.

## Purpose

The archive serves as:
- Historical reference for design decisions
- Legacy documentation for older versions
- Deprecated features documentation
- Superseded implementation guides

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Archive

Documents should be moved to archive when:
- Feature is deprecated or removed
- Documentation is superseded by newer version
- Design is no longer relevant to current implementation
- Information is outdated but historically significant

### Archive Structure

```
archive/
├── deprecated/     # Deprecated features
├── legacy/         # Old versions documentation
├── superseded/     # Replaced by newer docs
└── historical/     # Historical reference
```

### Accessing Archived Content

While archived content is not actively maintained:
- It may contain useful historical context
- Can help understand evolution of features
- May assist in migration from older versions

## Note

Archived documentation is provided as-is and may contain:
- Outdated information
- Broken links
- Deprecated API references
- Obsolete configuration examples

Always refer to current documentation in:
- [User Documentation](../user/)
