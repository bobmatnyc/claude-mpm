# Config Editor UI Update

## Changes Made

The ConfigScreenV2 YAML editor has been updated to use Save and Cancel buttons instead of control keys for better user experience.

### Previous Implementation
- **Save**: Ctrl+S
- **Cancel**: Esc

### New Implementation
- **Save Button**: Clearly visible button at the bottom of the editor
- **Cancel Button**: Located next to the Save button
- **Legacy Support**: Ctrl+S still works for backward compatibility but is deprecated

### Key Updates

1. **EnhancedConfigEditor Class** (`src/claude_mpm/manager/screens/config_screen_v2.py`)
   - Added `on_save` and `on_cancel` callback parameters
   - Created Save and Cancel button widgets
   - Added button bar to the layout at the bottom of the editor
   - Implemented `_on_save_button()` and `_on_cancel_button()` handlers

2. **Button Layout**
   - Buttons positioned at the bottom of the editor window
   - Fixed width for consistent appearance
   - Proper spacing between buttons
   - Consistent styling with the rest of the UI (`button` and `button_focus` attributes)

3. **User Feedback**
   - Save button saves changes and shows success message
   - Cancel button discards changes and reloads original content
   - Status messages updated to reference buttons instead of keyboard shortcuts

### Testing

Two test scripts were created to verify the implementation:
- `scripts/verify_config_buttons.py` - Automated verification of button existence and functionality
- `scripts/test_config_editor_buttons.py` - Interactive test for manual verification

### Benefits

1. **Improved Discoverability**: Buttons are visible, users don't need to know keyboard shortcuts
2. **Better Accessibility**: Click/activate actions are more accessible than keyboard shortcuts
3. **Consistent UX**: Follows standard UI patterns with Save/Cancel buttons
4. **Clear Actions**: Users can clearly see available actions at all times

### Backward Compatibility

The Ctrl+S shortcut is maintained for backward compatibility but is no longer documented in user-facing messages. The primary interaction method is now through the button interface.
