# Documentation Cleanup - Second Pass
## Date: 2025-01-11

## Summary
This second cleanup pass focused on archiving outdated implementation documents and consolidating overlapping documentation based on research findings.

## Files Archived

### Outdated Top-Level Documentation
These files were moved from `/docs/` to `/docs/archive/cleanup-2025-01-second-pass/`:

1. **PROJECT_AGENT_PRECEDENCE.md**
   - Reason: Duplicate content already covered in AGENTS.md
   - Content: Implementation details of the three-tier agent precedence system
   - Status: Superseded by consolidated AGENTS.md documentation

2. **CONFIG_EDITOR_UPDATE.md**
   - Reason: Temporary update document for completed UI changes
   - Content: Details about ConfigScreenV2 button updates
   - Status: Implementation complete, changes integrated

3. **AGENT_REGISTRY_CACHING.md**
   - Reason: Implementation detail documentation
   - Content: Technical details about agent registry caching mechanism
   - Status: Implementation complete, belongs in developer docs if needed

4. **AGENT_NAME_FORMATS.md**
   - Reason: Implementation detail documentation
   - Content: Naming convention details for agents
   - Status: Conventions established and integrated into main docs

### Logging Documentation Consolidation
These files were archived as their content is covered by RESPONSE_LOGGING_CONFIG.md:

5. **ASYNC_LOGGING.md**
   - Reason: Content overlaps with RESPONSE_LOGGING_CONFIG.md
   - Content: Async logging implementation details
   - Status: Consolidated into main logging guide

6. **SESSION_LOGGING.md**
   - Reason: Content overlaps with RESPONSE_LOGGING_CONFIG.md
   - Content: Session-based logging details
   - Status: Consolidated into main logging guide

## Directories Retained

### /docs/responses/
- **Decision**: KEPT
- **Reason**: Contains legitimate documentation for the response tracking system
- **Contents**: Development guide, technical reference, and user guide for response tracking

### /docs/schemas/
- **Decision**: KEPT
- **Reason**: Contains important schema documentation not present in /src/
- **Contents**: Agent schema documentation explaining field usage and requirements

### /docs/security/
- **Decision**: KEPT
- **Reason**: Contains critical security documentation for schema validation
- **Contents**: Security guide for agent schema and security notes

## Impact Assessment

### Documentation Structure Improvements
- Reduced duplication between top-level docs
- Clearer separation between active and archived documentation
- Better organization with consolidated logging documentation

### Files Remaining in /docs/
- AGENTS.md - Main agent system documentation
- DEPLOY.md - Deployment procedures
- MEMORY.md - Memory system documentation
- PROJECT_AGENTS.md - Project-local agent deployment
- QA.md - Quality assurance procedures
- RESPONSE_LOGGING_CONFIG.md - Consolidated logging configuration
- STRUCTURE.md - Project structure guide
- VERSIONING.md - Version management

### Archive Organization
The archive now has two cleanup passes:
- `/docs/archive/cleanup-2025-01/` - First pass (30+ files)
- `/docs/archive/cleanup-2025-01-second-pass/` - Second pass (6 files)

## Recommendations

1. **Future Cleanup**: Consider periodic reviews every 3-6 months
2. **Documentation Standards**: Establish clear criteria for top-level vs. subdirectory docs
3. **Archive Policy**: Define retention period for archived documentation
4. **Cross-References**: Update any broken links that may reference archived files
