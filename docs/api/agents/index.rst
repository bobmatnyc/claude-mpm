Overview
--------

The Claude MPM agent system is built around a flexible architecture that supports:

* **Dynamic Agent Discovery**: Automatic discovery of agents from multiple sources
* **Metadata Management**: Rich metadata including capabilities, specializations, and versions
* **Lifecycle Management**: Complete agent lifecycle from deployment to removal
* **Validation Framework**: Comprehensive validation of agent configurations and frontmatter

Key Components
--------------

Agent Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Handles the complete lifecycle of agents including deployment, updates, and removal.
Provides both synchronous and asynchronous deployment strategies.

Agent Registry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Maintains a registry of all available agents with rich metadata support including:

* Agent capabilities and specializations
* Version information and compatibility
* Performance metrics and usage statistics
* Framework and domain categorization

Agent Loaders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Flexible loading system supporting multiple agent formats and sources:

* File-based agent loading
* Asynchronous batch loading
* Integration with external agent repositories
* Caching and performance optimization

Agent Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Comprehensive validation system ensuring agent quality and compatibility:

* Frontmatter validation and schema compliance
* Configuration validation
* Dependency checking
* Security validation

Architecture Benefits
--------------------

* **Scalability**: Supports large numbers of agents with efficient discovery and loading
* **Flexibility**: Multiple loading strategies and extensible validation framework
* **Performance**: Intelligent caching and lazy loading for optimal performance
* **Reliability**: Comprehensive validation and error handling
* **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and modular architecture
