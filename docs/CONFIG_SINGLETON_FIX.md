# Configuration Singleton Fix

## Problem
The configuration was being loaded 11 times during startup, once for each service that created its own `Config()` instance. This caused:
- Performance overhead from repeatedly reading and parsing configuration files
- Increased memory usage from duplicate configuration objects
- Potential inconsistency if configuration was modified during runtime

## Root Cause Analysis
Each service was creating its own `Config` instance:
1. `ClaudeRunner.__init__` (line 56)
2. `BaseService.__init__` (line 102)
3. `InteractiveSession.__init__` (line 83)
4. `ResponseLoggingService.__init__` (line 175)
5. `UnifiedAgentRegistry.__init__` (line 49)
6. Multiple other services...

The `ConfigurationManager` cache was instance-specific, not global, so each `Config` instance had its own cache.

## Solution: Singleton Pattern Implementation

### Changes Made
Modified `/src/claude_mpm/core/config.py` to implement the singleton pattern:

1. **Added class-level singleton tracking**:
   ```python
   _instance = None
   _initialized = False
   ```

2. **Implemented `__new__` method** to ensure single instance:
   ```python
   def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
       if cls._instance is None:
           cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
           logger.info("Creating new Config singleton instance")
       else:
           logger.debug("Reusing existing Config singleton instance")
       return cls._instance
   ```

3. **Modified `__init__` method** to skip re-initialization:
   ```python
   def __init__(self, ...):
       if Config._initialized:
           logger.debug("Config already initialized, skipping re-initialization")
           return
       Config._initialized = True
       # ... rest of initialization
   ```

4. **Added reset method** for testing:
   ```python
   @classmethod
   def reset_singleton(cls):
       cls._instance = None
       cls._initialized = False
   ```

### Benefits
- **Performance**: Configuration loaded only once, reducing startup time
- **Memory**: Single configuration object shared across all services
- **Consistency**: All services guaranteed to use the same configuration
- **Transparency**: Change is transparent to existing code - no API changes needed

### Testing
Created comprehensive tests in `/tests/test_config_singleton.py`:
- Verifies singleton pattern works correctly
- Tests that configuration is shared across instances
- Tests reset functionality for test isolation
- Simulates actual service startup scenario

### Test Isolation
For tests that need clean configuration state, use the reset method:
```python
def setUp(self):
    Config.reset_singleton()  # Start with fresh config
    # ... rest of setup

def tearDown(self):
    Config.reset_singleton()  # Clean up after test
    # ... rest of teardown
```

### Verification
To verify the fix is working:
1. Look for "Creating new Config singleton instance" in logs - should appear only once
2. Look for "Reusing existing Config singleton instance" for subsequent uses
3. Configuration file should be loaded only once (look for "Successfully loaded configuration")

### Backward Compatibility
The change is fully backward compatible:
- No changes to the Config API
- Existing code continues to work without modification
- Parameters passed to Config() after first instantiation are ignored (logged as debug)
