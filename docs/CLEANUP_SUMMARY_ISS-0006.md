# Dead Code Cleanup Summary - ISS-0006

Date: 2025-01-25
Agent: Engineer

## Files Removed

### Backup Files (_original.py)
- `/src/claude_mpm/services/ticketing_service_original.py` - Legacy ticketing service backup

### Backup Files (.bak)
- `/src/claude_mpm/core/agent_registry.py.bak` - Agent registry backup
- `/src/claude_mpm/core/base_service.py.bak` - Base service backup

## Analysis Results

### Orchestrator Files
- All unused orchestrators are properly archived in `/src/claude_mpm/orchestration/archive/`
- No action needed as they are already organized

### Legacy Ticket System References
- Found references in tests and examples using sample ticket IDs (TSK-xxx, EP-xxx)
- These are legitimate test data and documentation examples, not legacy code
- The current ticket system uses `ai-trackdown` as a backend
- No legacy ticket system code found that needs removal

### TODO/FIXME Comments
- Most TODO comments found are related to the TODO hijacking feature, which is active functionality
- Found one deprecated module: `/src/claude_mpm/hooks/hook_client.py` (marked as DEPRECATED)
- This module is still in use but marked for future removal with migration guide

### Unused Imports
- Without pyflakes or similar tools installed, manual inspection was limited
- No obvious unused imports found in spot checks

## Summary

Successfully removed 3 backup files:
1. `ticketing_service_original.py`
2. `agent_registry.py.bak`
3. `base_service.py.bak`

The codebase is now cleaner with these backup files removed. All other findings were either:
- Already properly organized (orchestrators in archive/)
- Legitimate test data (ticket ID examples)
- Active features (TODO hijacking)
- Properly marked deprecations with migration paths

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, these files can be recovered from git history:
```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/claude_mpm/services/ticketing_service_original.py
git checkout HEAD~1 -- src/claude_mpm/core/agent_registry.py.bak
