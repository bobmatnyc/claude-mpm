# Agent Memory Protection Update Summary

## Updates Completed

### 1. Security Agent (v2.1.0 → v2.2.0)
- ✅ Added memory warning comments at the top of instructions
- ✅ Implemented Content Threshold System (20KB/200 lines single file, 100KB critical, 50KB/3 files cumulative)
- ✅ Added Memory Management Rules for sequential processing
- ✅ Defined Forbidden Memory Practices
- ✅ **Added Vulnerability Pattern Caching** - Cache only patterns, not file contents
- ✅ **Added SAST Memory Limits** - Maximum 5 files per security scan batch
- ✅ Created workflow example for vulnerability assessment

### 2. Engineer Agent (v2.3.0 → v3.5.0) 
- ✅ Added memory warning comments at the top of instructions
- ✅ Implemented Content Threshold System (20KB/200 lines single file, 100KB critical, 50KB/3 files cumulative)
- ✅ **Added Implementation Chunking** - Large implementations split into <100 line segments
- ✅ **Added Architecture-Aware Memory Limits** - Module analysis max 5 files, implementation in chunks
- ✅ Added Memory Management Rules specific to engineering tasks
- ✅ Defined Forbidden Memory Practices for codebases
- ✅ Created Implementation Chunking Strategy with detailed workflow

## Key Memory Protection Features

### Common Elements (Both Agents)
1. **Memory Warning Comments**: Three critical comments at the top warning about memory retention
2. **Content Threshold System**: 
   - Single file: 20KB/200 lines triggers summarization
   - Critical files: >100KB always summarized
   - Cumulative: 50KB total or 3 files triggers batch
3. **Sequential Processing**: One file at a time, never parallel
4. **Forbidden Practices**: Clear list of what NOT to do
5. **Targeted Reads**: Use Grep instead of full file reads when possible

### Security Agent Specific
- **Vulnerability Pattern Caching**: Cache only vulnerability signatures and patterns, not code
- **SAST Memory Limits**: Maximum 5 files per security scan batch
- **Security-focused workflow**: LS → Check size → Grep patterns → Cache findings → Discard

### Engineer Agent Specific  
- **Implementation Chunking**: Process large files in 100-200 line chunks
- **Architecture-Aware Limits**: Different limits for modules, tests, configs, docs
- **Module Interface Caching**: Cache only interfaces, types, and function signatures
- **Implementation workflow**: Grep boundaries → Read chunk → Implement → Discard → Repeat

## Workflow Examples

### Security Agent Workflow
```
1. LS to check file sizes
2. If <20KB: Read → Extract vulnerabilities → Cache patterns → Discard file
3. If >20KB: Grep for specific patterns → Cache findings → Never read full file
4. Generate report from cached patterns only
```

### Engineer Agent Workflow  
```
1. Grep for class/function definitions → Map architecture
2. Read interface definitions → Cache signatures only
3. Implement in 100-line chunks → Discard after each chunk
4. Use cached signatures for consistency
5. Never retain implementation details in memory
```

## Version Updates
- **security.json**: 2.1.0 → 2.2.0
- **engineer.json**: 2.3.0 → 3.5.0 (major version jump due to significant memory management enhancements)

## Impact
These updates ensure that both agents handle large codebases efficiently without accumulating memory, while maintaining their specialized capabilities. The security agent focuses on pattern caching for vulnerability detection, while the engineer agent emphasizes chunked implementation for large-scale development tasks.
