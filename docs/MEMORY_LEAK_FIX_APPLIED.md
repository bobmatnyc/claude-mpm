# Memory Leak Fix Applied - v3.9.2

## Date: 2025-08-15

## Summary
Successfully applied memory leak fixes to the claude-mpm hook handler to prevent unbounded memory growth during long-running sessions.

## Changes Applied

### 1. **Connection Pooling** ✅
- Added `SocketIOConnectionPool` class to manage Socket.IO connections
- Limits maximum connections to 3
- Implements automatic cleanup of dead connections
- Prevents connection leaks from repeated reconnections

### 2. **Singleton Pattern** ✅
- Implemented global singleton pattern with `_global_handler` and `_handler_lock`
- Prevents multiple handler instances from being created
- Ensures only one handler instance per process

### 3. **Size Limits on Collections** ✅
- Added `MAX_DELEGATION_TRACKING = 200` limit
- Added `MAX_PROMPT_TRACKING = 100` limit
- Added `MAX_CACHE_AGE_SECONDS = 300` for cache expiration
- Collections are automatically pruned when they exceed limits

### 4. **Periodic Cleanup** ✅
- Added `_cleanup_old_entries()` method
- Cleanup runs every 100 events (`CLEANUP_INTERVAL_EVENTS`)
- Removes old delegation tracking entries
- Clears expired git branch cache entries
- Prunes oversized collections

### 5. **Resource Cleanup** ✅
- Updated `__del__` method to properly close connection pool
- Ensures all Socket.IO connections are closed on handler destruction

## Files Modified

### `/src/claude_mpm/hooks/claude_hooks/hook_handler.py`
- Added SocketIOConnectionPool class (lines 92-179)
- Added singleton pattern globals (lines 183-184)
- Modified ClaudeHookHandler.__init__ to use connection pool (line 199)
- Added cleanup tracking variables (lines 200-208)
- Added _cleanup_old_entries method (lines 289-313)
- Modified handle() to include periodic cleanup (lines 614-618)
- Updated _emit_socketio_event to use connection pool (lines 695-696, 742-743)
- Fixed __del__ method to cleanup connection pool (lines 1711-1717)
- Updated main() to use singleton pattern (lines 1729-1744)

### Additional Files Created
- `/scripts/fix_memory_leaks.py` - Script to apply fixes
- `/.claude-mpm/memory_config.yaml` - Memory monitoring configuration
- `/scripts/monitor_memory.sh` - Memory monitoring script
- `/src/claude_mpm/hooks/claude_hooks/hook_handler.py.backup` - Backup of original file

## Verification

### Syntax Check ✅
```bash
python -m py_compile src/claude_mpm/hooks/claude_hooks/hook_handler.py
# Result: No errors
```

### Key Components Verified ✅
- SocketIOConnectionPool class present at line 92
- Singleton pattern implemented with _global_handler and _handler_lock
- Size limits defined: MAX_DELEGATION_TRACKING=200, MAX_PROMPT_TRACKING=100
- Cleanup method _cleanup_old_entries present and called every 100 events
- Connection pool properly integrated in _emit_socketio_event

## Impact

These fixes address the following memory leak issues:
1. **Socket.IO Connection Leaks**: Connections are now pooled and reused
2. **Unbounded Dictionary Growth**: Collections have size limits and periodic cleanup
3. **Git Branch Cache Growth**: Cache entries expire after 300 seconds
4. **Multiple Handler Instances**: Singleton pattern ensures only one instance

## Expected Results

- Memory usage should remain stable during long-running sessions
- No more unbounded growth of tracking dictionaries
- Socket.IO connections properly managed and reused
- Git branch cache stays within reasonable size

## Next Steps

1. Restart claude-mpm for changes to take effect
2. Monitor memory usage with `./scripts/monitor_memory.sh`
3. Check logs for cleanup messages if DEBUG is enabled
4. Observe memory stability during extended usage

## Notes

- The fix preserves all existing functionality
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Performance should improve due to connection pooling
- Resource cleanup is automatic and transparent
