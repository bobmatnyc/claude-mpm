# Documentation Standards

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: December 2025  
**Based on**: GitFlow Analytics documentation structure and Claude MPM framework requirements

## 📚 Documentation Philosophy

Our documentation follows a **progressive disclosure** model with clear audience segmentation for the Claude MPM multi-agent orchestration framework:

- **Users** find what they need to get started with Claude Code integration quickly
- **Developers** can dive deep into framework architecture and agent system implementation  
- **Contributors** have clear guidance on agent creation and framework extension
- **Maintainers** have architectural context for multi-agent orchestration decisions

## 📋 File Naming Conventions

### Standard Patterns
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `file-name.md`
- Be descriptive but concise: `agent-deployment.md` not `agents.md`
- Use consistent suffixes:
  - `-guide.md` for how-to documentation
  - `-reference.md` for technical specifications
  - `-overview.md` for high-level summaries
  - `-setup.md` for installation/configuration

### Special Files
- `README.md` - Directory index and navigation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history (root only)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines (root only)
- `SECURITY.md` - Security policy and guidelines

### Writing Style Guidelines

**Voice and Tone**:
- Use active voice: "Deploy the agent" not "The agent should be deployed"
- Be direct and concise
- Use "you" to address the reader
- Maintain a helpful, professional tone

**Technical Writing**:
- Define acronyms on first use (MCP = Model Context Protocol)
- Use consistent terminology throughout (Claude Code CLI, not "Claude CLI")
- Include complete, runnable examples
- Test all code samples before committing

**Framework-Specific Guidelines**:
- Always distinguish between FRAMEWORK (this repo) and PROJECT (user installations)
- Specify Claude Code CLI version requirements
- Include agent deployment examples
- Reference multi-agent orchestration patterns

## 🔗 Cross-Referencing Standards

### Internal Links
- Use relative paths: `[Configuration Reference](configuration/reference.md)`
- Link to specific sections: `[Installation](getting-started/installation.md#requirements)`
- Include "See Also" sections for related topics

### External Links
- Use full URLs for external resources
- Include link text that describes the destination
- Verify links regularly for accuracy

### Navigation Aids
- Each directory must have a `README.md` index
- Include breadcrumb navigation in complex documents
- Provide clear "Next Steps" guidance

## 📊 Quality Standards

### Content Quality

3. Update any links pointing to archived content
4. Add entry to archive index if needed

## 🚀 Implementation Guidelines

### For New Documentation
1. Determine appropriate category and directory
2. Follow naming conventions

4. Maintain backward compatibility where possible

## 🤖 Claude MPM-Specific Standards

### Framework vs Project Distinction
Always clarify context when writing documentation:

**PROJECT Documentation** (user installations):
- Location: Any directory where `mpm-init` has been run
- Purpose: Use Claude MPM for multi-agent orchestration
- Audience: End users, project teams
- Focus: Usage, configuration, workflows

### Agent System Documentation
- **Agent Templates**: Document in `reference/` with schema validation
- **Agent Workflows**: Document in `guides/` with practical examples
- **Agent Creation**: Document in `developer/` with step-by-step instructions
- **Agent Deployment**: Document in `deployment/` with operational guidance

### Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns
- Document delegation patterns between PM and specialist agents
- Include complete workflow examples with expected interactions
- Show error handling and circuit breaker patterns
- Provide troubleshooting for common orchestration issues

### Claude Code Integration
- Always specify minimum Claude Code CLI version requirements
- Include setup verification steps
- Document MCP integration patterns
- Provide troubleshooting for Claude Code-specific issues
