# Interactive Mode Solutions Summary

## Problem
Claude's interactive CLI requires direct terminal control, which is difficult to provide when wrapping it as a subprocess. The main issues are:
1. Claude expects a TTY (terminal) environment
2. Standard subprocess pipes don't provide the terminal features Claude needs
3. Prompts can't be submitted when Claude is run through pipes

## Solutions Attempted

### 1. **Direct Subprocess with Pipes** (Original Approach)
- **Status**: ❌ Failed - Claude exits after showing welcome screen
- **Issue**: No TTY, Claude can't handle interactive mode

### 2. **PTY Mode** (Using Python's pty module)
- **Status**: ❌ Failed - "Operation not supported by device" error
- **Issue**: PTY operations require specific terminal capabilities

### 3. **Pexpect Library**
- **Status**: ⚠️ Not tested - Requires external dependency
- **Issue**: Can't install pexpect due to macOS Python environment restrictions

### 4. **Direct Orchestrator** (Current Implementation)
- **Status**: ✅ Partially Working
- **Approach**: 
  1. Inject framework using Claude's print mode (`-p`)
  2. Then launch Claude in interactive mode directly
  3. Let Claude handle its own terminal I/O

## Recommended Approach

For now, the **Direct Orchestrator** provides the best balance:

```bash
# Interactive mode (launches Claude directly after framework injection)
claude-mpm

# Non-interactive mode (works perfectly)
claude-mpm -i "Your prompt here"
```

## Alternative Solutions

1. **Use Claude's `--continue` flag**: 
   - Save conversations and continue them
   - Requires managing conversation files

2. **Use MCP (Model Context Protocol)**:
   - Configure claude-mpm as an MCP server
   - Let Claude load the framework via MCP

3. **Use Claude's API instead of CLI**:
   - Would require significant refactoring
   - Better control over I/O

## Current Limitations

1. **Ticket Extraction**: In direct mode, we can't intercept Claude's output for real-time ticket extraction
2. **Session Logging**: Limited logging capabilities in interactive mode
3. **Framework Re-injection**: Can't re-inject framework mid-conversation

## Future Improvements

1. Implement MCP server mode for better integration
2. Create a web interface that handles terminal emulation
3. Use Claude's API for full control over interactions
