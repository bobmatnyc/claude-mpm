# Dynamic Agent Capabilities Implementation Summary

**Date:** July 27, 2025  
**Status:** Implemented and Tested

## Overview

Successfully implemented Phase 2 of the dynamic agent capabilities system as specified in `docs/design/claude-mpm-dynamic-agent-capabilities-design.md`. The system now dynamically generates agent capabilities from deployed agents instead of using static hardcoded content.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced ContentAssembler (`content_assembler.py`)

- Added integration with `DeployedAgentDiscovery` and `AgentCapabilitiesGenerator` services
- Modified `apply_template_variables()` to detect and replace `{{capabilities-list}}` placeholder
- Generates fresh agent capabilities on each processing
- Includes graceful error handling with fallback to default content

### 2. Updated INSTRUCTIONS.md Template

- Replaced static agent capabilities section with `{{capabilities-list}}` placeholder
- The placeholder is replaced dynamically during:
  - Content assembly
  - Deployment operations
  - Framework generation

### 3. Enhanced DeploymentManager

- Added dynamic content processing during deployment
- Detects INSTRUCTIONS.md format and skips CLAUDE.md validation
- Ensures fresh agent data is generated on each deployment
- Fixed version parsing to handle single string return value

### 4. Created Framework Detection Utility

- Added `framework_detection.py` to prevent deployment to framework source
- Detects framework markers to protect template files

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite:

1. **test_dynamic_capabilities.py**: Tests individual components and integration
2. **test_deployment_dynamic_capabilities.py**: Tests deployment scenarios
3. **test_real_deployment.py**: Tests with actual INSTRUCTIONS.md template

All tests pass successfully.

## Dynamic Content Example

The system generates content like:

```markdown
## Agent Names & Capabilities
**Core Agents**: data_engineer, documentation, engineer, ops, qa, research, security, version_control

**Agent Capabilities**:
- **Data Engineer Agent**: data, etl, analytics
- **Documentation Agent**: docs, api, guides
- **Engineer Agent**: coding, architecture, implementation
- **Ops Agent**: deployment, monitoring, infrastructure
- **Qa Agent**: testing, quality, validation
- **Research Agent**: Pre-implementation codebase analysis with confidence validation
- **Security Agent**: security, audit, compliance
- **Version Control Agent**: git, versioning, releases

**Agent Name Formats** (both valid):
- Capitalized: Data Engineer Agent, Documentation Agent, Engineer Agent...
- Lowercase-hyphenated: data_engineer, documentation, engineer...

*Generated from 8 deployed agents*
```

## Benefits

1. **Always Current**: Agent list reflects actual deployed agents
2. **Project-Specific**: Shows custom agents when deployed at project level
3. **Automatic Updates**: No manual maintenance required
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to default content if generation fails
5. **Backward Compatible**: Existing deployments continue to work

## Next Steps

The system is ready for production use. Future enhancements could include:

1. More detailed capability extraction from agent JSON files
2. Grouping agents by category or function
3. Including agent version information
4. Adding tool counts or complexity indicators
