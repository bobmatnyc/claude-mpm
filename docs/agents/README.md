## Featured Agent: Agentic Coder Optimizer üéÜ

### Overview  
The **[Agentic Coder Optimizer](AGENTIC_CODER_OPTIMIZER.md)** is a breakthrough operations agent that transforms projects for optimal AI agent compatibility. Following the principle of **"ONE way to do ANYTHING,"** it eliminates complexity and creates discoverable, unified workflows.

### Key Transformations
- **‚ö° 5-Minute Setup**: Reduces onboarding from hours to minutes
- **üéØ Unified Commands**: `make dev`, `make test`, `make build` work on ANY project
- **üìö Smart Documentation**: Creates discoverable hierarchy (README ‚Üí CLAUDE ‚Üí DEVELOPER)
- **üîß Quality Gates**: Automated formatting, testing, and security checks
- **ü§ñ AI-Optimized**: Structure and language optimized for AI agent understanding

### Real Impact Examples
**React SaaS Project:**
- Setup time: 3.5 hours ‚Üí 4 minutes (90% reduction)
- Test commands: 12 different ways ‚Üí `make test` (100% consistency)
- Developer satisfaction: 95% "Much easier to contribute"

**Legacy Python API:**
- Consolidated 15 shell scripts into 5 `make` commands
- Documentation: 3-page wiki ‚Üí single DEVELOPER.md
- New developer productivity: Day 1 instead of Week 1

### Quick Start
```bash
# Transform any project for agentic coding
PM: "Run the Agentic Coder Optimizer - implement ONE way to do everything"

# Focus on specific optimization
PM: "Create unified commands and 5-minute developer setup"

# Full project health analysis
PM: "Analyze optimization opportunities and show before/after impact"
```

### When to Use
- üÜï **New Projects**: Set agentic standards from day one
- üîÑ **Legacy Modernization**: Consolidate complex, scattered tooling  
- üìö **Documentation Chaos**: Create clear, discoverable information hierarchy
- üë• **Team Onboarding**: Reduce setup time and improve developer experience
- ü§ñ **AI Agent Workflows**: Optimize project structure for AI agent effectiveness

## Using Agents in Claude MPM

### Agent Selection
The PM automatically selects the most appropriate agent based on task requirements:

```bash
# Project optimization ‚Üí Agentic Coder Optimizer
PM: "Standardize this project for AI agents with unified commands"

# Engineering tasks ‚Üí Engineer Agent
PM: "Add user authentication to the application"

# Deployment tasks ‚Üí Vercel Ops Agent  
PM: "Deploy the application to Vercel with custom domain"

# Testing tasks ‚Üí QA Agent
PM: "Run comprehensive tests on the preview deployment"

# Documentation tasks ‚Üí Documentation Agent
PM: "Update the API documentation with new endpoints"
```

### Agent Coordination
Agents coordinate seamlessly through the PM workflow, with the Agentic Coder Optimizer often setting the foundation:

```
Agentic Coder Optimizer ‚Üí Engineer ‚Üí Vercel Ops ‚Üí QA ‚Üí Documentation
         ‚Üì                   ‚Üì           ‚Üì         ‚Üì         ‚Üì
   Optimize Structure     Feature    Deployment  Testing   Update Docs
   Create Commands      Complete    to Preview  Preview   with Changes
   Set Quality Gates
```

### Multi-Agent Workflows
Complex tasks involve multiple agents working together, often starting with optimization:

#### New Feature with Optimization
```
1. Agentic Coder Optimizer: Ensure project has unified commands and quality gates
2. Engineer: Implement new payment feature using standard workflow (make test, make quality)
3. Security: Review payment security implementation
4. Vercel Ops: Deploy to preview with payment API integration  
5. QA: Test payment flows using unified test commands (make test, make test-e2e)
6. Documentation: Update payment guide in optimized documentation structure
7. Vercel Ops: Deploy to production with rolling release
```

#### Legacy Project Modernization  
```
1. Agentic Coder Optimizer: Transform project structure and create unified workflows
2. Engineer: Migrate features to new structure while maintaining functionality
3. QA: Validate all existing functionality works with new commands
4. Documentation: Update all guides to reflect optimized structure
5. Ops: Deploy using new unified deployment process
```

## Agent Customization

### Project-Level Agents
Create project-specific agents in `.claude-mpm/agents/`:

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir -p .claude-mpm/agents

# Add custom Vercel Ops configuration
cat > .claude-mpm/agents/vercel_ops.json << 'EOF'
{
  "agent_id": "vercel_ops",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Custom Vercel Ops for this project"
  },
  "knowledge": {
    "project_domains": ["app.mycompany.com", "staging.mycompany.com"],
    "environments": ["development", "staging", "production"],
    "frameworks": ["nextjs"],
    "integrations": ["auth0", "stripe", "sendgrid"]
  },
  "instructions": "# Project Vercel Ops\n\nCustom configuration for MyCompany application deployment..."
}
EOF
```

### Agent Precedence
Project agents override system agents:
- **PROJECT** (`.claude-mpm/agents/`) - Highest precedence
- **USER** (`~/.claude-mpm/agents/`) - Medium precedence  
- **SYSTEM** (Built-in framework agents) - Lowest precedence
