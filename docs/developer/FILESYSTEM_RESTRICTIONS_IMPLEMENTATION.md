# Filesystem Restrictions Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive filesystem access restrictions across all Claude MPM agent templates to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access to system directories.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created PM (Project Manager) Agent
- **File**: `.claude/agents/pm.yaml`
- **Purpose**: Orchestrate multi-agent workflows with strict working directory constraints
- **Key Restrictions**: 
  - Most explicit warnings about staying within working directory
  - Special protocol for handling user requests to leave working directory

### 2. Updated All Agent YAML Files
Added `file_access` configuration to all agents with:
```yaml
file_access:
  allowed_paths: ["./**"]
  denied_paths: ["../**", "/etc/**", "~/.ssh/**", "/usr/**", "/sys/**", "/home/**", "/root/**"]
```

### 3. Agent-Specific Restrictions

#### Security Agent (Most Restrictive)
- Read-only access within working directory
- Additional denied paths: `~/.aws/**`, `~/.config/**`
- No shell command execution
- Explicit security principles for handling file access

#### Engineer Agent
- Standard restrictions with clear documentation about directory changes
- Must get user confirmation for external directory access

#### Research Agent
- Analysis scope limited to working directory
- Bash commands must respect directory boundaries

#### QA Agent
- Test execution limited to project test directories
- Test artifacts must be contained within project

#### Documentation Agent
- Documentation creation limited to project docs/ directory
- Can reference but not modify external resources

#### Ops Agent
- Additional restrictions on system directories: `/var/**`, `/opt/**`
- Deployment operations limited to project scope
- Infrastructure changes require explicit approval

#### Data Engineer Agent
- Cannot access system databases (`/var/lib/**`)
- Data processing limited to project directories
- External data access requires permission

#### Version Control Agent
- Git operations limited to current repository
- Cannot modify global git config
- Additional restriction on `~/.gitconfig`

## Security Benefits

1. **Prevents Accidental System Access**: Agents cannot accidentally modify system files
2. **Contains Operations**: All agent operations are contained within project boundaries
3. **Explicit Permission Model**: External access requires user confirmation
4. **Audit Trail**: All directory access attempts are documented in agent reports
5. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of restrictions (YAML config + instruction warnings)

## Usage Notes

- The PM agent should be the primary orchestrator for multi-agent workflows
- If users need agents to access external directories, they must explicitly request and confirm
- Security agent has the most restrictive settings and should be used for all security-sensitive operations
- All agents must report file operations in their completion reports

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test that agents properly reject attempts to access forbidden paths
2. Verify that file_access restrictions are enforced by the framework
3. Test the PM agent's directory change protocol
4. Ensure agent reports properly document all file operations

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Whitelist approach instead of blacklist for even tighter control
- Per-project custom restrictions
- Dynamic restriction updates based on security context
- Integration with OS-level sandboxing mechanisms
