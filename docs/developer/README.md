## Key Concepts

### Framework Architecture
Claude MPM provides a modular framework with:
- Pluggable components
- Service-oriented design
- Clean interfaces
- Extensible hooks

### Agent System
Multiple specialized agents handle different aspects:
- **Engineer Agent**: Code implementation
- **QA Agent**: Testing and quality assurance
- **Documentation Agent**: Documentation creation
- **Research Agent**: Code analysis and exploration
- **Security Agent**: Security reviews
- And more...

### Hook System
Extensible architecture through pre/post hooks:
- Message interception
- Response transformation
- Custom automation
- Third-party integrations

### Socket.IO Reliability
Advanced reliability features for production deployments:
- **PID File Validation**: Enhanced process identity checking
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive system health tracking
- **Automatic Recovery**: Circuit breaker patterns and graduated recovery
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Detailed error messages with resolution steps
- **Service Management**: Production-ready daemon and service management

See [Socket.IO Reliability Features](SOCKETIO_RELIABILITY.md) for complete documentation.
