# Task Tool Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the Task tool handling to accept both agent name formats, creating consistency between TodoWrite and Task tool usage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Agent Instructions (`src/claude_mpm/agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md`)
- Added new section "Task Tool Agent Name Format" explaining that both formats are accepted
- Provided clear mapping between TodoWrite format (capitalized) and Task format (lowercase-hyphenated)
- Added examples showing both formats work correctly
- Instructed Claude to normalize capitalized formats internally

### 2. Updated Simple Runner Context (`src/claude_mpm/core/simple_runner.py`)
- Modified `create_simple_context()` function to include information about both naming formats
- Added clear instructions that both capitalized and lowercase formats are accepted
- Emphasized automatic normalization when capitalized names are used

### 3. Updated Framework Documentation Generator (`src/claude_mpm/services/framework_claude_md_generator/section_generators/todo_task_tools.py`)
- Expanded the Task tool documentation to show both accepted formats
- Added examples demonstrating usage with both capitalized and lowercase formats
- Made it clear that both formats work correctly

### 4. Verified Existing Infrastructure
- Confirmed `AgentNameNormalizer` class already has the necessary methods:
  - `to_task_format()`: Converts from TodoWrite format to Task format
  - `from_task_format()`: Converts from Task format to TodoWrite format
- Created test script to verify conversions work correctly

## Key Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Users can now use the same agent names in both TodoWrite and Task tools
2. **Flexibility**: Both naming conventions are supported, reducing confusion
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code using lowercase-hyphenated format continues to work
4. **Clear Documentation**: Instructions and examples show both formats are valid

## Examples of Enhanced Usage

Users can now use either format:
- `Task(description="Analyze patterns", subagent_type="Research")` ✅
- `Task(description="Analyze patterns", subagent_type="research")` ✅
- `Task(description="Git operations", subagent_type="Version Control")` ✅
- `Task(description="Git operations", subagent_type="version-control")` ✅

## Implementation Notes

Since the Task tool is handled by Claude itself (not by Python code), the enhancement was achieved by:
1. Updating Claude's instructions to accept both formats
2. Instructing Claude to normalize capitalized formats internally
3. Providing clear documentation and examples

This approach ensures that Claude will correctly handle both naming formats without requiring changes to the underlying tool infrastructure.
