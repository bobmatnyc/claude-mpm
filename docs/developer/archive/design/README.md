# Claude MPM Design Documentation

This directory contains design documents and architectural decisions for Claude MPM.

## Design Documents

### [Subprocess Orchestration Design](subprocess-orchestration.md)
Detailed design for the subprocess orchestration system, including:
- Architecture overview
- Process management strategies
- Communication protocols
- Error handling and recovery

### [TODO Hijacking System Design](todo_hijacking.md)
Design for the automatic TODO/task extraction system:
- Pattern recognition approach
- Ticket creation workflow
- Integration with ai-trackdown
- Extensibility considerations

## Design Principles

### 1. Modularity
- Each component should have a single, well-defined responsibility
- Components should be loosely coupled
- Interfaces should be clearly defined

### 2. Extensibility
- Hook system for custom behaviors
- Plugin architecture for agents
- Configurable orchestration strategies

### 3. Reliability
- Graceful error handling
- Process supervision and recovery
- Comprehensive logging

### 4. Performance
- Efficient subprocess communication
- Minimal overhead for pattern matching
- Asynchronous operations where appropriate

## Architecture Decisions

### Subprocess vs Library Integration
We chose subprocess orchestration over library integration because:
- Complete isolation from Claude process
- Ability to manage different Claude versions
- Better error containment
- Easier debugging and monitoring

### Event-Driven Architecture
The hook system provides:
- Decoupled components
- Easy extensibility
- Clear execution flow
- Testable behaviors

### Agent System Design
Dynamic agent discovery enables:
- Project-specific agents
- User customization
- Runtime flexibility
- Easy agent addition/removal

## Future Considerations

### Planned Enhancements
- Distributed agent execution
- Multi-Claude instance orchestration
- Advanced ticket management workflows
- Real-time collaboration features

### Scalability
- Message queue integration
- Horizontal scaling of agents
- Caching strategies
- Performance optimizations

## Contributing to Design

When proposing design changes:
1. Create a new design document in this directory
2. Include problem statement, proposed solution, and alternatives
3. Consider impact on existing systems
4. Add diagrams where helpful
5. Request review from maintainers
