# Pre-Refactoring Checkpoint

**Tag:** pre-refactoring-v4.14.7
**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Version:** 4.14.7-build.468
**Commit:** b6be16d9ee8545ddd983bd6cfd3b11b3f13baf32

## Purpose
Safety checkpoint before Phase 1 critical refactoring based on codebase analysis.

## Current State
- ✅ All 163 core tests passing
- ✅ Quality gate clean
- ✅ Security scan clean
- ✅ Production-ready (4.5/5 stars)
- ✅ Comprehensive analysis complete in `docs/developer/codebase-analysis.md`

## Planned Changes
See `docs/developer/codebase-analysis.md` for full details.

### Phase 1 Critical Fixes (16-24 hours)
1. **Refactor 4 F-grade functions** (CC > 40 → <10)
   - `cli/commands/lint.py::run_lint()` (CC: 43)
   - `services/logging/structured_logger.py::StructuredLogger._format_message()` (CC: 41)
   - `utils/version_utils.py::get_version_display()` (CC: 40)
   - `cli/commands/agent.py::deploy_agent()` (CC: 40)

2. **Split 7 monolithic files** (>1,500 lines → ~300 lines each)
   - `src/claude_mpm/__init__.py` (3,617 lines)
   - `tests/unit/test_services_agent_registry.py` (3,508 lines)
   - `tests/unit/test_services_agent_deployment.py` (3,334 lines)
   - `src/claude_mpm/services/agent/__init__.py` (2,835 lines)
   - `tests/unit/test_agents_code.py` (2,724 lines)
   - `src/claude_mpm/cli/__init__.py` (2,180 lines)
   - `tests/unit/test_agents_pm.py` (1,870 lines)

3. **Fix 3 __init__.py anti-patterns** (803 lines → <100)
   - `src/claude_mpm/services/core/__init__.py` (803 lines)
   - `src/claude_mpm/services/communication/__init__.py` (451 lines)
   - `src/claude_mpm/services/infrastructure/__init__.py` (369 lines)

4. **Resolve test coverage measurement timeout**
   - Current: Timeout issues with pytest-cov
   - Target: Reliable coverage measurement in <5 minutes

## How to Rollback

If refactoring needs to be reverted:

```bash
# Option 1: Reset to checkpoint (destructive - loses all changes)
git reset --hard pre-refactoring-v4.14.7

# Option 2: Create revert branch (non-destructive - preserves work)
git checkout -b revert-refactoring pre-refactoring-v4.14.7

# Option 3: Cherry-pick specific commits to undo
git revert <commit-sha>

# Option 4: Compare and selectively restore files
git diff pre-refactoring-v4.14.7 -- path/to/file.py
git checkout pre-refactoring-v4.14.7 -- path/to/file.py
```

## Verification Commands

To verify checkpoint state:

```bash
# Check tag exists locally and remotely
git tag -l pre-refactoring-v4.14.7
git ls-remote --tags origin | grep pre-refactoring-v4.14.7

# View tag details and annotation
git show pre-refactoring-v4.14.7

# Compare current state to checkpoint
git diff pre-refactoring-v4.14.7

# List files changed since checkpoint
git diff --name-only pre-refactoring-v4.14.7

# Show statistics of changes since checkpoint
git diff --stat pre-refactoring-v4.14.7

# View commit history since checkpoint
git log pre-refactoring-v4.14.7..HEAD --oneline
```

## Test Baseline

Run tests at checkpoint to verify baseline:

```bash
# Checkout checkpoint (detached HEAD)
git checkout pre-refactoring-v4.14.7

# Run quality checks
make quality
# Expected: 163/163 tests passing

# Return to main branch
git checkout main
```

## Metrics Baseline

From codebase analysis at checkpoint:

**Size Metrics:**
- Total LOC: 220,179
- Source LOC: 46,129 (21%)
- Test LOC: 174,050 (79%)
- Test/Source Ratio: 3.77:1

**Quality Metrics:**
- F-grade functions (CC > 40): 4
- E-grade functions (CC 31-40): 8
- Files >1,500 lines: 7
- Largest __init__.py: 803 lines

**Coverage Metrics:**
- Core modules: 85%+ coverage
- CLI commands: 70%+ coverage
- Services: 80%+ coverage
- Issue: Timeout prevents full measurement

**Target Metrics After Phase 1:**
- F-grade functions: 0
- E-grade functions: 0-2 (acceptable complexity)
- Files >1,500 lines: 0-2 (primarily test suites)
- __init__.py files: <100 lines each
- Coverage measurement: <5 minutes, reliable

## Backup Branch

A backup branch has been created for additional safety:

```bash
# View backup branch
git log backup/pre-refactoring-4.14.7 --oneline -5

# Compare main to backup
git diff backup/pre-refactoring-4.14.7..main

# Restore from backup if needed
git checkout -b recovery backup/pre-refactoring-4.14.7
```

## Refactoring Progress Tracking

Track progress against this checkpoint:

```bash
# Count F-grade functions remaining
radon cc -s -a src/claude_mpm --min F

# Count files >1,500 lines
find src/claude_mpm tests -name "*.py" -exec wc -l {} \; | awk '$1 > 1500'

# Check __init__.py sizes
find src/claude_mpm -name "__init__.py" -exec wc -l {} \; | sort -rn | head -5

# Run test coverage (if fixed)
pytest --cov=claude_mpm --cov-report=term-missing tests/
```

## Success Criteria

Phase 1 refactoring is complete when:

1. ✅ Zero F-grade functions (CC < 40)
2. ✅ Max 2 E-grade functions (CC 31-40)
3. ✅ Max 2 files >1,500 lines (only test suites)
4. ✅ All __init__.py files <100 lines
5. ✅ Test coverage measured in <5 minutes
6. ✅ All 163+ tests passing
7. ✅ Quality gate clean (make quality)
8. ✅ No regressions in functionality

## Notes

- This checkpoint includes the comprehensive codebase analysis document
- All quality checks were passing at checkpoint creation
- Remote backup ensures recoverability even after force pushes
- Tag is annotated with full context for future reference
- Backup branch provides additional recovery option
