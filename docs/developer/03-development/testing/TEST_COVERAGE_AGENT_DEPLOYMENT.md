# Agent Deployment Test Coverage Report

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of test coverage for the agent deployment functionality in claude-mpm.

## Overview

The agent deployment system is tested through multiple test files that cover different aspects of the deployment process:

1. **Integration Tests** (scripts/test_agent_deployment*.py)
2. **Unit Tests** (tests/services/test_*.py)
3. **Validation Tests** (tests/test_agent_deployment_validation.py)

## Test Files and Their Coverage

### 1. scripts/test_agent_deployment.py
**Purpose**: Basic integration testing of AgentDeploymentService

**Coverage**:
- ✅ Service initialization with default paths
- ✅ Agent deployment to temporary directory with force_rebuild=True
- ✅ Deployment results reporting (total, deployed, updated, migrated, skipped, errors)
- ✅ YAML file generation and basic validation
- ✅ Sample content verification from deployed files

**Gaps**:
- ❌ Version checking/update logic
- ❌ Deployment without force_rebuild
- ❌ Migration from old version formats
- ❌ Error handling scenarios
- ❌ Environment variable configuration
- ❌ Deployment verification
- ❌ Cleanup functionality

### 2. scripts/test_agent_deployment_validation.py
**Purpose**: Validates field mapping from JSON templates to YAML files

**Coverage**:
- ✅ Agent deployment to temporary directory
- ✅ YAML frontmatter parsing and validation
- ✅ Field mapping verification (JSON → YAML)
- ✅ Tools field mapping validation
- ✅ Description and tags field mapping
- ✅ Instruction content preservation
- ✅ Deployment statistics reporting

**Gaps**:
- ❌ allowed_tools/disallowed_tools mapping
- ❌ Temperature and model field mapping
- ❌ Priority field assignment
- ❌ YAML syntax correctness validation
- ❌ Deployment update scenarios
- ❌ Version field handling

### 3. scripts/test_agent_deployment_integration.py
**Purpose**: Tests integration with agent loader

**Coverage**:
- ✅ AgentDeploymentService initialization
- ✅ Individual agent deployment with success/failure tracking
- ✅ Deployed agent content validation
- ✅ Comparison between direct loading and deployment
- ✅ Model selection through deployment with complexity factors
- ✅ Integration with agent loader (get_agent_prompt)

**Gaps**:
- ❌ Concurrent deployments
- ❌ Partial deployment failures
- ❌ Deployment rollback scenarios
- ❌ Custom template directories
- ❌ Base agent merging logic
- ❌ Deployment to production directories

### 4. tests/test_agent_deployment_validation.py
**Purpose**: Comprehensive validation of deployed agent configurations

**Coverage**:
- ✅ YAML structure validation
- ✅ Agent permissions (security, QA agents)
- ✅ Temperature settings per agent type
- ✅ Priority assignment validation
- ✅ Model configuration consistency
- ✅ YAML cleanliness (essential fields only)

**Gaps**:
- ❌ Pre-deployment setup automation
- ❌ Cross-agent dependency validation
- ❌ Performance benchmarks
- ❌ Stress testing with many agents

### 5. tests/services/test_deployed_agent_discovery.py
**Purpose**: Unit tests for agent discovery service

**Coverage**:
- ✅ Service initialization (default/custom roots)
- ✅ Agent discovery with new/legacy schemas
- ✅ Empty agent list handling
- ✅ Error handling during discovery
- ✅ Agent info extraction with missing attributes
- ✅ Source tier determination
- ✅ Error logging

**Gaps**:
- ❌ Concurrent discovery operations
- ❌ Large-scale agent lists
- ❌ Filesystem-based discovery
- ❌ Integration with actual registry

### 6. tests/services/test_agent_capabilities_generator.py
**Purpose**: Unit tests for capability documentation generation

**Coverage**:
- ✅ Successful capability section generation
- ✅ Empty agent list handling
- ✅ Error handling with invalid data
- ✅ Agent grouping by tier
- ✅ Core agent list generation
- ✅ Capability text generation with fallbacks
- ✅ Long text truncation
- ✅ Fallback content generation

**Gaps**:
- ❌ Template customization
- ❌ Internationalization
- ❌ Capability filtering
- ❌ Performance with large lists

## Critical Missing Test Coverage

### 1. Version Management
- No tests for semantic versioning migration
- No tests for version comparison logic
- No tests for update decision making

### 2. Error Scenarios
- Missing template files
- Corrupted JSON templates
- Invalid YAML generation
- Filesystem permission errors
- Network failures during deployment

### 3. Environment Configuration
- Environment variable setting/validation
- Claude configuration directory setup
- Path resolution edge cases

### 4. Deployment Lifecycle
- Clean deployment from scratch
- Incremental updates
- Rollback procedures
- Cleanup operations

### 5. Production Scenarios
- Deployment to actual .claude/agents directory
- User-created agent preservation
- System agent updates
- Concurrent access handling

## Recommendations

1. **Add Version Management Tests**
   - Test version parsing and comparison
   - Test migration from old to new formats
   - Test update decision logic

2. **Add Error Handling Tests**
   - Mock filesystem errors
   - Test with invalid templates
   - Test recovery mechanisms

3. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Full deployment lifecycle tests
   - Multi-agent deployment scenarios
   - Production-like environment tests

4. **Add Performance Tests**
   - Large agent set deployment
   - Concurrent operation handling
   - Resource usage monitoring

5. **Add Regression Tests**
   - Ensure backward compatibility
   - Test upgrade paths
   - Validate legacy support

## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all agent deployment tests
pytest tests/test_agent_deployment_validation.py -v
pytest tests/services/test_deployed_agent_discovery.py -v
pytest tests/services/test_agent_capabilities_generator.py -v

# Run integration test scripts
python scripts/test_agent_deployment.py
python scripts/test_agent_deployment_validation.py
python scripts/test_agent_deployment_integration.py
```

## Conclusion

The current test coverage provides good validation of core functionality but lacks comprehensive coverage of error scenarios, version management, and production deployment scenarios. Priority should be given to adding tests for version management and error handling as these are critical for production reliability.
