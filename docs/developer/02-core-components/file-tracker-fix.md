# File Tool Tracker JavaScript Error Fix

## Issue Description
The dashboard's `file-tool-tracker.js` component was throwing a JavaScript error when processing events:

```
Error in event update callback: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'includes')
    at file-tool-tracker.js:77:93
```

This error occurred when the component attempted to call `.includes()` on `event.subtype` when that field was undefined.

## Root Cause
The error happened in multiple locations where the code was checking if `event.subtype` included certain strings without first verifying that `event.subtype` existed and was a string:

```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (before fix):
if (event.subtype === 'pre_tool' || event.type === 'hook' && !event.subtype.includes('post')) {
    // ...
}
```

When `event.subtype` was undefined, calling `.includes('post')` would throw a TypeError.

## Solution
Added proper null/undefined checks before calling string methods on potentially undefined properties:

```javascript
// FIXED CODE (after fix):
if (event.subtype === 'pre_tool' || (event.type === 'hook' && event.subtype && !event.subtype.includes('post'))) {
    // ...
}
```

## Changes Made
Fixed three locations in `/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/js/components/file-tool-tracker.js`:

1. **Line 77**: Added null check for `event.subtype` before calling `.includes()`
2. **Line 79**: Added null check for `event.subtype` before calling `.includes()`
3. **Line 165-167**: Added null checks in the `updateToolCalls` method
4. **Line 324**: Added type check to ensure `event.subtype` is a string before calling `.includes()`

## Testing
A test script was created at `/scripts/test_file_tracker_fix.py` that sends various event types to verify the fix:
- Events with normal subtypes
- Events with missing subtypes (undefined)
- Events with null subtypes
- Events with empty string subtypes
- Events with wrong type subtypes (numeric)

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Always validate input**: Check that properties exist before accessing their methods
2. **Use optional chaining**: Consider using `?.` operator where supported
3. **Type checking**: Verify that values are the expected type before using type-specific methods
4. **Defensive programming**: Assume external data might be incomplete or malformed

## Impact
This fix ensures the dashboard remains stable when processing events from various sources that might not include all expected fields, improving overall reliability and user experience.
