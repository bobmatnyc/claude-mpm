# Framework Loader Status Report

## Executive Summary

✅ **The framework loader is fully operational and working correctly.**

All instruction components are being loaded and assembled properly:
- WORKFLOW.md ✅
- MEMORY.md ✅  
- PM.md memories ✅
- All other components ✅

## Component Loading Status

### Files Successfully Loaded

| Component | Source | Size | Status |
|-----------|--------|------|--------|
| INSTRUCTIONS.md | `src/claude_mpm/agents/` | 9,620 bytes | ✅ Loaded |
| BASE_PM.md | `src/claude_mpm/agents/` | 7,891 bytes | ✅ Loaded |
| WORKFLOW.md | `src/claude_mpm/agents/` | 4,656 bytes | ✅ Loaded |
| MEMORY.md | `src/claude_mpm/agents/` | 3,493 bytes | ✅ Loaded |
| PM.md | `.claude-mpm/memories/` | 1,022 bytes | ✅ Loaded |

### Loading Precedence (Working Correctly)

1. **Project-specific files** (`.claude-mpm/agents/`) - Highest priority ✅
2. **System/Framework files** (`src/claude_mpm/agents/`) - Fallback ✅
3. **Memories** (`.claude-mpm/memories/PM.md`) - Always loaded ✅

## Key Features Verified

### 1. WORKFLOW.md Loading
- ✅ Loads from `src/claude_mpm/agents/WORKFLOW.md` by default
- ✅ Can be overridden by `.claude-mpm/agents/WORKFLOW.md`
- ✅ Content properly integrated into final instructions
- ✅ Includes "Mandatory Workflow Sequence" rules

### 2. MEMORY.md Loading  
- ✅ Loads from `src/claude_mpm/agents/MEMORY.md` by default
- ✅ Can be overridden by `.claude-mpm/agents/MEMORY.md`
- ✅ Content properly integrated into final instructions
- ✅ Includes "Static Memory Management Protocol"

### 3. PM Memory Loading
- ✅ Loads from `.claude-mpm/memories/PM.md`
- ✅ Injected into instructions under "Current PM Memories" section
- ✅ Properly formatted with introduction text
- ✅ Memories available to PM during operations

### 4. Final Assembly
- ✅ All components assembled in correct order
- ✅ Metadata comments stripped
- ✅ Agent capabilities dynamically generated
- ✅ Temporal context (today's date) added
- ✅ Total size: ~27KB of comprehensive instructions

## Code Locations

### Framework Loader
- **File**: `src/claude_mpm/core/framework_loader.py`
- **Key Methods**:
  - `_load_workflow_instructions()` - Lines 185-221
  - `_load_memory_instructions()` - Lines 222-257
  - `_load_actual_memories()` - Lines 259-281
  - `get_framework_instructions()` - Lines 426-514

### System Instructions Service
- **File**: `src/claude_mpm/services/system_instructions_service.py`
- **Integration**: Uses FrameworkLoader at lines 61-69

## Testing Verification

Created and ran comprehensive tests:

1. **test_framework_loader_complete.py** - Verifies all components load
2. **test_system_instructions_integration.py** - Verifies service integration
3. **test_framework_precedence_complete.py** - Tests override precedence
4. **show_framework_loader_output.py** - Inspects final output

All tests pass ✅

## No Issues Found

The initial concern that WORKFLOW.md and MEMORY.md weren't being loaded was incorrect. Investigation shows:

1. **Files exist** in `src/claude_mpm/agents/`
2. **Loader finds them** correctly
3. **Content is loaded** into memory
4. **Instructions are assembled** properly
5. **PM memories are injected** from `.claude-mpm/memories/PM.md`

## Conclusion

The framework loader is functioning exactly as designed. No fixes are needed.

### What's Working
- ✅ System file loading
- ✅ Project override support
- ✅ Memory injection
- ✅ Complete assembly
- ✅ Proper precedence

### Recommendations
No changes needed. The system is operational and correctly:
1. Loading all instruction components
2. Respecting precedence rules
3. Injecting PM memories
4. Assembling complete instructions for the PM
