# Dashboard Hub Consolidation

## Overview

The Claude MPM dashboard system has been consolidated into a single, unified hub with clear organization and navigation. This improves usability and makes it easier to find and access the appropriate monitoring tools.

## New Dashboard Hub

**Location**: `/static/index.html`

The new dashboard hub features:
- Modern, card-based design with hover effects
- Clear categorization: Production, Development, and Legacy
- Visual indicators (icons, badges, colors) for easy identification
- Detailed descriptions for each dashboard
- Quick start guide and connection information
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

- **Production dashboards** copied to `/static/production/`
- **Legacy dashboards** remain in `/static/legacy/`

### Files Created
- Enhanced dashboard hub at `/static/index.html`
- Production directory structure
- Archive directory for test files

### Files Updated
- Added navigation bars to all production dashboards
- Updated links and paths for new structure
- Enhanced visual design and user experience

## Access Instructions

1. **Start the monitor server**:
