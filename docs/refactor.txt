 1. Redundancy and Code Duplication

   * `claude_runner.py` and `simple_runner.py`: These two files are nearly identical. This is a significant redundancy that
     increases the maintenance burden.
   * `agent_registry.py` and `agent_registry.py.bak`: The .bak file is likely a backup and should be removed to avoid
     confusion. The same applies to base_service.py and base_service.py.bak.
   * `config.py` and `config_aliases.py`: These files have overlapping responsibilities. The logic for handling
     configuration and its aliases could be consolidated into a single, more robust configuration management module.
   * `session_manager.py` and `agent_session_manager.py`: These files manage different aspects of sessions but could be
     combined into a more comprehensive session management service.

  Recommendation:

   * Merge simple_runner.py into claude_runner.py and remove the duplicate file.
   * Delete the .bak files.
   * Refactor the configuration management into a single module.
   * Combine the session management logic into a unified service.

  2. Lack of Abstraction and Tight Coupling

   * `claude_runner.py`: This file has direct dependencies on AgentDeploymentService, TicketManager, and HookService. This
     tight coupling makes it difficult to test the runner in isolation.
   * `framework_loader.py`: This module has hardcoded paths and logic for detecting the framework, which makes it brittle.

  Recommendation:

   * Introduce a dependency injection container (like the one in container.py) to manage dependencies. This will decouple
     the components and make them easier to test and maintain.
   * Use the ServiceRegistry to register and resolve services instead of direct instantiation.
   * Refactor framework_loader.py to use a more flexible and configurable approach for locating the framework.

  3. Inconsistent Naming and Conventions

   * `listAgents` vs. `list_agents`: The agent_registry.py module has both camelCase and snake_case method names. This is
     inconsistent and should be standardized.
   * `ConfigPaths`: This class uses class methods to provide paths, but a simple namespace or a dictionary would be more
     straightforward.

  Recommendation:

   * Standardize on snake_case for all method and function names.
   * Refactor ConfigPaths to be a simple namespace or a dictionary of constants.

  4. Potential Performance Issues

   * `agent_registry.py`: The agent discovery process involves scanning the filesystem every time. This could be slow,
     especially in large projects.

  Recommendation:

   * Implement a caching mechanism for the agent registry to avoid unnecessary filesystem scans. The cache_service
     interface is already defined in interfaces.py, so it should be implemented and used.

  5. Lack of Error Handling

   * `claude_runner.py`: The run_interactive method has a broad except Exception block that catches all exceptions. This
     can hide bugs and make debugging difficult.

  Recommendation:

   * Implement more specific error handling to catch and handle different types of exceptions.

  6. Unused and Deprecated Code

   * The hooks/builtin directory is marked as deprecated in the hooks/README.md file. This directory should be removed to
     avoid confusion.
   * The orchestration/archive directory contains several old orchestrator implementations that are likely no longer in
     use.

  Recommendation:

   * Remove the hooks/builtin and orchestration/archive directories.

  Next Steps

  Based on this analysis, I will proceed with the following actions:

   1. Consolidate redundant code: I will start by merging the duplicate runner and removing the .bak files.
   2. Improve configuration management: I will refactor the configuration logic into a single, more robust module.
   3. Introduce dependency injection: I will use the DIContainer and ServiceRegistry to decouple the components.
   4. Standardize naming conventions: I will refactor the code to use consistent naming conventions.
   5. Improve performance: I will implement a caching mechanism for the agent registry.
