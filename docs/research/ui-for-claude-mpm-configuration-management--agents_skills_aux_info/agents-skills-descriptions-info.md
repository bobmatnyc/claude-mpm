The monitoring dashboard shows several tabs like "Agents", "Skills", withing the "Config" tab section. 
Both Agent and Skill definitions have descriptions and other relevant information that can be useful for users to understand the purpose and functionality of each Agent and Skill.
There might not be a clear line between the agent or skill definition and what should be displayed in the UI.

In a typical scenario, agents and skills are retrieved from a git repo. These repos are available for inspection in:
1) /Users/mac/workspace/claude-mpm-skills
2) /Users/mac/workspace/claude-mpm-agents

Research how agents and skills are defined, what information is available in their definitions, and what information would be most useful to display in the UI to help users understand their purpose and functionality.
This involves understanding how claude-mpm retrieves, stores and keeps track of agents and skills, and how this information can be surfaced in the monitoring dashboard in a way that is clear and informative for users.
This also involves researching how to display agent or skill information in the dashboard. 

Create a team to research this topic in depth. One of the team member should play devil's advocate to verify, challange and suggest.
Write results to docs/research/ui-for-claude-mpm-configuration-management--agents_skills_aux_info for my review.
