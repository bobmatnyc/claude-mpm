# Dashboard Enhancements Guide

## Overview

Claude MPM's dashboard has been significantly enhanced to provide better insights into your multi-agent workflows. This guide covers the key features introduced in version 3.4.0: agent consolidation, enhanced prompt analysis, and integrated git diff viewing.

## Agent Consolidation

### What It Is

The agent consolidation feature groups all activities from the same type of agent into unified entries, giving you a cleaner view of your agent usage patterns.

### Benefits

- **Cleaner Interface**: Instead of seeing 10 separate entries for "DocumentationAgent", you see one consolidated entry
- **Better Analytics**: Quickly see which agents you use most frequently
- **Aggregated Metrics**: Total delegation counts, combined event counts, and time ranges at a glance
- **Detailed History**: Still access individual delegation details when needed

### How to Use

1. **Navigate to the Agents Tab**: Click the "Agents" tab in the dashboard
2. **View Consolidated Entries**: Each unique agent type appears as a single row showing:
   - Agent name (e.g., "DocumentationAgent", "CodeReviewAgent")
   - Number of times delegated
   - Total events generated
   - Time range from first to last use

3. **Access Details**: Click any consolidated agent to see:
   - Individual delegation sessions
   - Specific prompts used
   - Event timelines
   - Performance metrics

### Example

Instead of seeing:
```
DocumentationAgent (Session 1) - 15 events
DocumentationAgent (Session 2) - 8 events  
DocumentationAgent (Session 3) - 22 events
```

You now see:
```
üìÑ DocumentationAgent
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 3 delegations, 45 total events
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Used from 09:15 AM to 02:30 PM
```

## Enhanced Prompt Viewer

### What It Is

The enhanced prompt viewer provides intelligent analysis of your prompts and agent instructions, including token counting, text metrics, and improved formatting.

### Key Features

#### Token Counting
- **Automatic Estimation**: Get approximate token counts for all prompts
- **Context Planning**: Understand how much of your LLM context window is being used
- **Cost Estimation**: Better predict API costs based on token usage

#### Text Metrics
- **Character Count**: Total characters including spaces
- **Word Count**: Number of words for readability analysis
- **Line Count**: Number of lines for formatting reference

#### Smart Formatting
- **Whitespace Cleanup**: Removes excessive spaces and normalizes formatting
- **HTML Safety**: Automatically escapes potentially dangerous content
- **Truncation**: Long prompts are smartly truncated with expansion options

### How to Use

1. **Select Any Event**: Click on any event in the Events tab
2. **View Enhanced Prompts**: In the detail panel, look for prompt sections that now show:
   ```
   üìù User Prompt (estimated 45 tokens, 180 chars, 32 words)
   ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
   ‚îÇ Please create comprehensive docs... ‚îÇ
   ‚îÇ [Click to expand full prompt]       ‚îÇ
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
   ```
3. **Analyze Metrics**: Use the metrics to:
   - Plan context usage across multiple agent calls
   - Optimize prompt length for efficiency
   - Track prompt complexity over time

### Practical Applications

#### Context Window Management
```
Total Context: 4,096 tokens
Current prompt: 350 tokens
Agent response: ~800 tokens  
Memory context: 200 tokens
Remaining: ~2,746 tokens ‚úÖ
```

#### Prompt Optimization
- **Too Long**: Prompts over 500 tokens may need simplification
- **Just Right**: 100-300 tokens often work well for most tasks
- **Too Short**: Very brief prompts may lack necessary context

## Git Diff Viewer

### What It Is

An integrated git diff viewer that shows file changes directly in the dashboard without switching to external tools.

### Benefits

- **Workflow Integration**: See changes in context of your file operations
- **Visual Clarity**: Syntax-highlighted diffs with color coding
- **No Tool Switching**: Everything in one interface
- **Copy Functionality**: Easy copying of diff content

### How to Use

#### Accessing Diffs

1. **Go to Files Tab**: Navigate to the Files tab in the dashboard
2. **Look for Diff Icons**: Files with git changes show a üìã icon
3. **Click to View**: Click the diff icon to open the diff viewer

#### Understanding the Display

The diff viewer shows:

- **File Header**: File path and timestamp
- **Diff Metadata**: Commit hash and diff method used
- **Color-Coded Changes**:
  - üü¢ **Green lines**: Additions (lines starting with +)
  - üî¥ **Red lines**: Deletions (lines starting with -)
  - üîµ **Blue headers**: Context information (@@...@@)
  - ‚ö™ **White lines**: Unchanged context

#### Example Diff

```diff
üìã Git Diff: src/example.js

commit: abc1234
method: git diff HEAD~1

@@ -10,7 +10,8 @@ function processData(input) {
     return null;
   }
 
-  const result = input.map(item => item.value);
+  const result = input.map(item => item.value || 0);
+  console.log('Processing:', result.length, 'items');
   
   return result.filter(value => value > 0);
 }
```

### File Status Indicators

- **üìã Tracked & Modified**: File is in git and has changes
- **üìù Untracked**: File exists but isn't in git yet
- **‚ùå No Changes**: File is tracked but unchanged
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Error**: Can't access git information

### Advanced Features

#### Keyboard Navigation
- **Escape**: Close diff viewer
- **Ctrl+C**: Copy diff content (when focused)

#### Error Handling
The system gracefully handles:
- Files not in git repositories
- Network connectivity issues
- Permission problems
- Large diff files
