# QA Security Test Report

## Executive Summary
The file security hook implementation has been thoroughly tested and validated. All security requirements have been met successfully.

## Test Results

### 1. Unit Test Verification ✅
- **Status**: PASSED (9/9 tests)
- **Coverage**: Security-critical code paths fully tested
- **Test Cases**:
  - ✅ Write within working directory (allowed)
  - ✅ Write outside working directory (blocked)
  - ✅ Path traversal attempts (blocked)
  - ✅ MultiEdit outside directory (blocked)
  - ✅ NotebookEdit outside directory (blocked)
  - ✅ Read operations anywhere (allowed)
  - ✅ Relative path resolution
  - ✅ Symlink resolution
  - ✅ Invalid path handling

### 2. Manual Testing ✅
- **Status**: All scenarios working as expected
- **Test Results**:
  - Writes within project: ALLOWED
  - Writes outside project: BLOCKED with clear error messages
  - Path traversal: BLOCKED with security warning
  - Read operations: ALLOWED from any location

### 3. Edge Case Testing ✅
- **Status**: All edge cases handled correctly
- **Cases Tested**:
  - Empty file paths: Handled gracefully
  - Null byte injection: BLOCKED
  - Unicode traversal: BLOCKED
  - Temp directory writes: BLOCKED
  - Special characters: Handled correctly
  - Long paths: Handled correctly
  - Missing/invalid parameters: Handled gracefully

### 4. Read vs Write Testing ✅
- **Read Operations**: Working correctly (allowed anywhere)
  - Read tool: ✅
  - Grep tool: ✅
  - LS tool: ✅
- **Write Operations**: Correctly restricted
  - Write tool: ✅
  - Edit tool: ✅
  - MultiEdit tool: ✅
  - NotebookEdit tool: ✅

### 5. Integration Testing ✅
- **Status**: Security policies enforced correctly
- **Scenarios**:
  - Legitimate project writes: ALLOWED
  - System file modifications: BLOCKED
  - Sandbox escape attempts: BLOCKED
  - Information gathering: ALLOWED

### 6. Performance Testing ✅
- **Status**: NEGLIGIBLE performance impact
- **Measurements**:
  - Allowed writes: ~0.031ms per check
  - Blocked writes: ~0.036ms per check
  - Read operations: ~0.002ms per check
- **Conclusion**: < 1ms overhead per operation

## Security Implementation Details

### Path Validation Logic
1. **Pre-check**: Detect '..' in paths before resolution
2. **Resolution**: Use Path.resolve() to get absolute paths
3. **Validation**: Check if resolved path is within working directory
4. **Error Handling**: Block on any validation failure

### Blocked Scenarios
- Absolute paths outside working directory
- Path traversal using '..'
- Symlinks pointing outside working directory
- Invalid paths (null bytes, etc.)

### Allowed Operations
- All read operations (Read, Grep, LS, etc.)
- Write operations within working directory
- Relative paths that resolve within project

## Error Messages
Clear, helpful error messages are provided:
- Path traversal: Specific warning about '..' usage
- Outside directory: Shows working directory and attempted path
- Invalid paths: Technical error details

## Logging
- Security violations logged with WARNING level
- Successful operations logged at INFO level
- Errors logged with full details

## QA Sign-off

✅ **APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION**

The file security hook implementation successfully:
1. Prevents all write operations outside the working directory
2. Allows read operations from any location
3. Provides clear error messages
4. Has negligible performance impact
5. Handles all edge cases gracefully
6. Works correctly with PM and all agents

**Tested by**: QA Agent
**Date**: 2025-07-27
**Version**: claude-mpm 1.1.0

## Recommendations
1. The implementation is robust and ready for use
2. Consider adding metrics collection for security events
3. Regular security audits should include hook testing
4. Documentation should highlight this security feature
