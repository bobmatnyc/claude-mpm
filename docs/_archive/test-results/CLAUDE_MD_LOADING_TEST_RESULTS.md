# CLAUDE.md Auto-Loading Test Results

## Executive Summary

**Claude DOES automatically load CLAUDE.md files** from the working directory and parent directories. This is a built-in feature of the Claude CLI, not just the claude-mpm framework.

## Test Methodology

1. Created test directory structure with CLAUDE.md files at multiple levels
2. Ran Claude CLI directly (without claude-mpm wrapper) from different directories
3. Tested both interactive and non-interactive modes
4. Verified behavior through subprocess calls

## Key Findings

### 1. Automatic CLAUDE.md Loading Confirmed

Claude automatically loads CLAUDE.md files without any special flags or configuration. The loading behavior is:

- **Current Directory**: Always loaded if present
- **Parent Directories**: Recursively loaded up the directory tree
- **Multiple Files**: All CLAUDE.md files in the path hierarchy are loaded

### 2. Loading Order and Hierarchy

When running Claude from `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm/claude-md-test/level1/`, it loads:

1. `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm/CLAUDE.md` (grandparent)
2. `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm/claude-md-test/CLAUDE.md` (parent)
3. `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm/claude-md-test/level1/CLAUDE.md` (current)

### 3. Evidence from Direct Testing

#### Test 1: Root directory
```bash
cd /Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm
claude -p "What CLAUDE.md files do you see?"
```
Result: Loaded `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm/CLAUDE.md`

#### Test 2: Nested directory
```bash
cd /Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm/claude-md-test/level1
claude -p "What CLAUDE.md files do you see?"
```
Result: Loaded all 3 CLAUDE.md files in the hierarchy

#### Test 3: Subprocess verification
```python
subprocess.run(["claude", "-p", prompt], cwd=test_dir)
```
Result: Consistent behavior - CLAUDE.md files loaded based on working directory

### 4. No Documentation in --help

The `claude --help` output does not mention CLAUDE.md loading, suggesting this is an undocumented but intentional feature.

### 5. Implications for claude-mpm

The claude-mpm framework's CLAUDE.md loading functionality may be redundant since Claude already handles this automatically. However, claude-mpm might:
- Provide additional processing or validation
- Ensure consistent behavior across different Claude versions
- Add custom logic for CLAUDE.md handling

## Test Artifacts

- Test directory structure: `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm/claude-md-test/`
- Test script: `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm/test_claude_md_subprocess.py`
- Test CLAUDE.md files with markers:
  - TEST-ROOT-MARKER
  - TEST-LEVEL1-MARKER
  - ISOLATED-CLAUDE-MD

## Conclusion

Claude has built-in CLAUDE.md loading functionality that automatically discovers and loads CLAUDE.md files from the current working directory and all parent directories. This is not a feature implemented by claude-mpm but rather a core feature of the Claude CLI itself.
