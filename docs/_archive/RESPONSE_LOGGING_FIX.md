# Response Logging Fix Summary

## Issue
The response logging system was not clearly showing whether hook.subagent_stop and hook.stop events were being captured properly.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Debug Logging
Enhanced debug logging in `src/claude_mpm/hooks/claude_hooks/hook_handler.py`:

- **Stop Event Processing** (lines 1039-1059):
  - Added debug output showing response_tracking_enabled status
  - Added debug output showing if response_tracker exists
  - Added debug output showing session_id, reason, and stop_type
  - Added debug output showing if output and prompt_data are present

- **SubagentStop Event Processing** (lines 1166-1184):
  - Added debug output showing response_tracking_enabled status
  - Added debug output showing if response_tracker exists
  - Added debug output showing session_id, agent_type, and reason
  - Added debug output showing delegation_requests keys to verify tracking
  - Added debug output showing if request_info is found

- **Task Delegation Tracking** (lines 730-748):
  - Added debug output when Task delegation is detected
  - Added debug output showing session_id and agent_type normalization
  - Added debug output confirming delegation was tracked
  - Added debug output showing current delegation_requests

- **_track_delegation Method** (lines 117-137):
  - Added debug output when method is called
  - Added debug output showing stored delegation request details
  - Added debug output showing total delegation_requests stored

### 2. Configuration Update
Updated `.claude-mpm/configuration.yaml` to include:
```yaml
response_logging:
  enabled: true
  format: json
  debug: true
  session_directory: ".claude-mpm/responses"
  track_all_interactions: false
  excluded_agents: []
```

### 3. Test Script Created
Created `scripts/test_response_logging_debug.py` to verify the fix:
- Tests delegation tracking with debug output
- Simulates Task, SubagentStop, and Stop events
- Verifies responses are logged correctly
- Shows debug output to confirm flow

## Verification

### How to Enable Debug Mode
Set the environment variable:
```bash
export CLAUDE_MPM_HOOK_DEBUG=true
```

### How to Test
Run the test script:
```bash
python scripts/test_response_logging_debug.py
```

### Expected Output
You should see debug messages like:
```
[DEBUG] Task delegation tracking:
  - session_id: test_ses...
  - agent_type: research
[DEBUG] _track_delegation called:
  - Stored delegation request for session test_ses...
[DEBUG] SubagentStop event processing:
  - response_tracking_enabled: True
  - request_info present: True
✅ Tracked research agent response on SubagentStop
[DEBUG] Stop event processing:
  - output present: True (length: 377)
  - prompt_data present: True
✅ Tracked main Claude response on Stop event
```

## Response Files Location
Response files are saved to `.claude-mpm/responses/` with filenames like:
- `20250812_113905-research-20250812T113905_548354.json` (SubagentStop)
- `20250812_113905-claude_main-20250812T113905_549114.json` (Stop)

Each file contains:
- `timestamp`: When the response was tracked
- `agent`: The agent that generated the response
- `session_id`: Session identifier for correlation
- `request`: Original request/prompt
- `response`: The agent's response
- `metadata`: Additional tracking information

## Key Findings

1. **The system IS working correctly** - Both Stop and SubagentStop events are being captured
2. **Files are saved asynchronously** - The ClaudeSessionLogger uses async writes by default
3. **Default location is used** - Responses go to `.claude-mpm/responses/` regardless of test config
4. **Debug output is essential** - The added debug logging makes it easy to verify the flow

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding a `--debug` flag to the CLI to enable debug output without environment variables
2. Add a command to view/search response logs: `claude-mpm responses list`
3. Consider adding response log rotation/cleanup for old files
4. Add metrics/statistics on response logging performance
