# Archive Documentation

This directory contains curated archived documentation following the August 2025 documentation reorganization and deep pruning. Files are preserved for historical reference and troubleshooting.

## üìã Archive History

### August 2025 Reorganization
Claude MPM documentation was reorganized into a cleaner, audience-focused structure:

**Before**: Mixed files in root `/docs/` directory
**After**: Organized into `/user/`, `/developer/`, `/agents/`, `/reference/` sections

### August 24, 2025 Deep Pruning
The archive was significantly pruned to remove redundant content and optimize storage:

- **Files Reduced**: From ~150+ to 77 files
- **Size Reduction**: 5.2M ‚Üí 944K (82.7% reduction)
- **Backup Created**: `docs_archive_backup_20250824_133926.tar.gz` (4.3M compressed)
- **Content Removed**: Redundant screenshots, completed implementation docs, outdated test reports

### October 7, 2025 Major Cleanup
Comprehensive cleanup removed obsolete files and freed significant space:

- **Files Removed**: 103 obsolete files
- **Space Freed**: 40.4 MB
- **Directories Cleaned**: `temporary/`, `dashboard-fixes-2025/` and other obsolete subdirectories
- **Current Version**: v4.7.3
- **Focus**: Retained only essential historical documentation and critical references

## üìÇ Current Archive Structure (Post-October 2025 Cleanup)

The archive now contains only essential historical content after the major October 2025 cleanup:

### `old-versions/` - Historical Release Information
- **`release-notes/`** - Version-specific release notes (v3.6.0 - v4.0.x)
- **`releases/`** - Historical changelogs and version documentation

### `screenshots/dashboard/` - Reference Screenshots
- **`dashboard_initial.png`** - Original dashboard state (preserved for reference)
- **`dashboard_final.png`** - Final dashboard state (preserved for reference)
- **Note**: 3.7M of redundant screenshots were removed during August 2025 pruning

### `test-reports/` - Critical Test Documentation
Key QA reports and verification results with lasting value:
- Memory system verification reports
- Agent deployment testing
- Critical system fixes validation
- **Note**: Further optimized during October 2025 cleanup

**Removed Directories** (October 2025):
- `temporary/` - 103 obsolete files removed, 40.4 MB freed
- `dashboard-fixes-2025/` - Completed work, no longer needed
- Other obsolete subdirectories and redundant content

## üéØ Usage Guidelines

**Use archived content for**:
- Understanding historical implementation decisions
- Troubleshooting issues with context from past fixes
- Compliance and audit trails
- Researching how features evolved over time
- Reference for architectural changes and their rationale

**For current documentation**, use the main docs directory:
- [User Documentation](../user/README.md)
- [Developer Documentation](../developer/README.md)
- [Agent Documentation](../agents/README.md)
- [Reference Documentation](../reference/README.md)

## üóÇÔ∏è Content Recovery

If you need content that was removed during pruning:

1. **Check the backup**: `docs_archive_backup_20250824_133926.tar.gz`
2. **Review pruning details**: [PRUNING_REPORT_20250824.md](./PRUNING_REPORT_20250824.md)
3. **Consider if current docs**: Content may have been moved to current documentation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Curated content**: Archive now contains only essential historical documentation
- **No longer maintained**: Content in this archive is not updated

- **Link integrity**: Internal links may be broken due to reorganization
- **Context matters**: Consider the date context when referencing archived content
- **Cleanup benefits**:
  - August 2025: 82.7% size reduction (5.2M ‚Üí 944K)
  - October 2025: Additional 40.4 MB freed, 103 obsolete files removed
