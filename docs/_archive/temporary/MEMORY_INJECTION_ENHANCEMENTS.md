# Memory Injection System Enhancements

## Overview
The memory injection system has been enhanced to ensure memories are only loaded for deployed agents, with improved logging and diagnostics for better visibility into the memory loading process.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Deployment Check Verification
- **Location**: `src/claude_mpm/core/framework_loader.py`
- The system checks if agents are deployed before loading their memories
- Deployed agents are identified by `.md` files in `.claude/agents/` directories
- Both project-level and user-level agent directories are checked

### 2. Enhanced Logging
- More descriptive skip messages showing which agent is not deployed
- Detection and warning for naming mismatches (e.g., `version-control` vs `version_control`)
- Comprehensive summary of memory loading results
- Debug logging of available deployed agents for reference

### 3. Agent Memory Injection into Instructions
- Agent memories are now properly injected into the framework instructions
- They appear in a dedicated "## Agent Memories" section
- Each agent's memory is clearly labeled with the agent name
- This ensures agent-specific knowledge is available to the PM

### 4. Memory File Format
- Memory files must follow the `{agent_name}_memories.md` format
- PM memories use the special format `PM_memories.md`
- The system correctly extracts agent names by removing the `_memories` suffix

## How It Works

### Loading Process
1. **Discovery**: The system finds all deployed agents from `.claude/agents/` directories
2. **Memory Search**: Looks for `*_memories.md` files in `.claude-mpm/memories/` directories
3. **Deployment Check**: For each memory file (except PM_memories.md):
   - Extracts the agent name from the filename
   - Checks if that agent is in the deployed agents set
   - Loads the memory if deployed, skips if not
4. **Aggregation**: Memories from multiple sources are aggregated per agent
5. **Injection**: Memories are injected into the framework instructions

### Directory Structure
```
~/.claude/agents/           # User-level deployed agents
  ├── engineer.md
  ├── qa.md
  └── ...

.claude/agents/             # Project-level deployed agents
  └── ...

~/.claude-mpm/memories/     # User-level memories
  ├── PM_memories.md        # Always loaded
  └── engineer_memories.md  # Loaded if engineer is deployed

.claude-mpm/memories/       # Project-level memories
  ├── PM_memories.md        # Always loaded
  ├── qa_memories.md        # Loaded if qa is deployed
  └── ops_memories.md       # Loaded if ops is deployed
```

### Logging Examples

#### Successful Load
```
INFO - Loaded project memory for engineer: engineer_memories.md (514 bytes)
```

#### Skipped Memory (Agent Not Deployed)
```
INFO - Skipped project memory: debug_duplicate_agent_memories.md (agent 'debug_duplicate_agent' not deployed)
```

#### Naming Mismatch Warning
```
WARNING - Naming mismatch detected: Memory file uses 'version-control' but deployed agent is 'version_control'. Consider renaming version-control_memories.md to version_control_memories.md
```

#### Summary
```
INFO - Memory loading complete: PM memory loaded | 6 agent memories loaded | 2 non-deployed agent memories skipped
DEBUG - Deployed agents available for memory loading: engineer, ops, qa, research, security, version_control
```

## Testing

### Verification Test
Run the comprehensive test to verify the memory injection system:
```bash
python tests/test_memory_injection_enhancements.py
```

This test verifies:
- Non-deployed agent memories are properly skipped
- Deployed agent memories are loaded correctly
- PM memories are always loaded
- Memories are injected into framework instructions
- Proper logging messages are generated

### Quick Verification
To quickly check if memories are being loaded correctly:
```python
from claude_mpm.core.framework_loader import FrameworkLoader

loader = FrameworkLoader()
instructions = loader.get_framework_instructions()

# Check PM memories
assert "## Current PM Memories" in instructions

# Check agent memories
assert "## Agent Memories" in instructions
```

## Benefits

1. **Efficiency**: Only loads memories for agents that are actually available
2. **Clarity**: Clear logging shows what was loaded and what was skipped
3. **Diagnostics**: Warnings help identify configuration issues
4. **Flexibility**: Supports both user-level and project-level memories
5. **Knowledge Preservation**: Agent-specific knowledge is properly injected

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Projects
- Rename any memory files that don't follow the `{agent_name}_memories.md` format
- Fix any naming mismatches (underscores vs hyphens)
- Check logs for skipped memories that should be loaded

### Common Issues
1. **Memory not loading**: Check if the agent is deployed in `.claude/agents/`
2. **Naming mismatch**: Ensure memory filename matches deployed agent name exactly
3. **Old format**: Migrate from `{agent_name}.md` to `{agent_name}_memories.md`
