# Socket.IO Dashboard Stability Fixes

## Problem
Users were experiencing frequent disconnections with the Socket.IO dashboard, causing poor user experience and missed events.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Engine.IO ping conflicts** - Server's custom ping/pong mechanism conflicting with Engine.IO's built-in heartbeat
2. **Aggressive timeout settings** - Health check intervals too short, causing premature disconnections
3. **Connection timeout too short** - 5 second timeout insufficient for slower connections
4. **Client-server settings mismatch** - Ping/pong intervals not aligned between client and server

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Socket.IO Server Configuration (`src/claude_mpm/services/socketio/server/core.py`)
**Already in place:**
```python
self.sio = socketio.AsyncServer(
    cors_allowed_origins="*",
    logger=False,
    engineio_logger=False,
    ping_interval=25,  # Send ping every 25 seconds
    ping_timeout=60,   # Wait 60 seconds for pong response
    max_http_buffer_size=1e8,  # 100MB max buffer
)
```

### 2. Dashboard Client Configuration (`src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/js/socket-client.js`)
**Already in place:**
```javascript
this.socket = io(url, {
    autoConnect: true,
    reconnection: true,
    reconnectionDelay: 1000,
    reconnectionDelayMax: 5000,
    reconnectionAttempts: Infinity,  // Keep trying indefinitely
    timeout: 20000,  // 20 second connection timeout
    forceNew: true,
    transports: ['websocket', 'polling'],
    pingInterval: 25000,  // Match server setting
    pingTimeout: 60000    // Match server setting
});
```

**Health check timeout updated:**
- Changed health check timeout from 30000ms to 90000ms for more lenient monitoring
- This prevents false positive stale connection detection

### 3. Connection Handler (`src/claude_mpm/services/socketio/handlers/connection.py`)
**Already in place:**
```python
self.ping_interval = 45  # seconds - avoid conflict with Engine.IO pings
self.ping_timeout = 20  # seconds - more lenient timeout
self.stale_check_interval = 90  # seconds - less frequent checks
```

### 4. EventBus Relay (`src/claude_mpm/services/event_bus/relay.py`)
**Already in place:**
```python
# Connect to server with longer timeout
self.client.connect(
    f"http://localhost:{self.port}",
    wait=True,
    wait_timeout=10.0,  # Increased from 5.0 to 10.0 seconds
    transports=['websocket', 'polling']
)
```

### 5. Stability Test Script (`scripts/verification/test_socketio_stability.py`)
**Created new comprehensive test script that:**
- Monitors connection stability over 2 minutes
- Tracks uptime/downtime percentages
- Measures ping/pong round-trip times
- Tests event delivery reliability
- Calculates stability score (0-100)
- Provides recommendations for improvements

## Expected Improvements

### Before Fixes
- Frequent disconnections every 30-60 seconds
- "Connection lost" messages in dashboard
- Missed events during reconnection
- Poor user experience

### After Fixes
- Stable connections for extended periods
- Automatic reconnection when network issues occur
- No conflicting ping/pong mechanisms
- Better handling of slow connections
- Comprehensive monitoring to detect issues

## Testing

Run the stability test to verify improvements:
```bash
# Start the Socket.IO server
claude-mpm monitor

# In another terminal, run the stability test
python scripts/verification/verify_socketio_stability.py
```

The test will run for 2 minutes and provide:
- Connection uptime percentage
- Disconnection count and reasons
- Ping/pong RTT measurements
- Event delivery success rate
- Overall stability score (target: 75+)

## Key Configuration Values

| Setting | Server | Client | Purpose |
|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| Engine.IO Ping Interval | 25s | 25s | Built-in heartbeat |
| Engine.IO Ping Timeout | 60s | 60s | Connection timeout |
| Custom Ping Interval | 45s | - | Application-level health check |
| Custom Ping Timeout | 20s | - | Custom ping response timeout |
| Health Check Interval | - | 90s | Client stale connection detection |
| Connection Timeout | - | 20s | Initial connection timeout |
| Stale Check Interval | 90s | - | Server cleanup interval |

## Monitoring

The stability improvements can be monitored through:
1. Dashboard connection status indicator
2. Server logs showing connection/disconnection events
3. Stability test script metrics
4. Browser console for client-side events

## Future Improvements

1. **Adaptive timeouts** - Adjust timeouts based on network conditions
2. **Connection quality metrics** - Display RTT and packet loss in dashboard
3. **Automatic recovery** - Detect and fix common connection issues
4. **Load balancing** - Support multiple Socket.IO server instances
5. **Event persistence** - Store events during disconnections for replay
