# Dashboard Connection Fix - August 2025

## Problem Summary
The dashboard was experiencing critical connection failures where:
- Clients would connect but immediately disconnect
- Event handlers were not available when clients connected
- Connection health checks were timing out incorrectly
- EventBus relay wasn't resilient to connection failures

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Event Handler Registration Timing (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Event handlers were registered AFTER the server started accepting connections
- Server starts â†’ Accepts connections â†’ Then registers handlers
- Clients connect but find no handlers â†’ Immediate disconnection

**Fix**: Register handlers BEFORE server starts accepting connections
- Modified `core.py` to call `_register_events_async()` before server startup
- Added async event registration method in `main.py`

### 2. Connection Manager Lacking Retry Logic
**Problem**: Connection registration could fail without retry
- No error handling in `register_connection()`
- No exponential backoff for retries
- Health checks used too long timeout (180s)

**Fix**: Added comprehensive retry logic
- 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff
- Better error handling and validation
- Reduced stale timeout to 90s for faster detection

### 3. Configuration Timing Issues
**Problem**: Ping/pong intervals too long for stability
- Ping interval was 45s, too long for reliable detection
- Stale timeout was 180s, too slow to detect issues

**Fix**: Adjusted timing for better stability
- Reduced ping_interval to 25s (was 45s)
- Reduced stale_timeout to 90s (was 180s)  
- Added connection_timeout parameter (10s)

### 4. EventBus Relay Lacked Resilience
**Problem**: Relay would fail if broadcaster wasn't ready
- No retry logic when broadcaster unavailable
- No exponential backoff
- Silent failures without recovery

**Fix**: Added resilient connection handling
- 10 retry attempts with exponential backoff
- Maximum 30s retry delay
- Better error logging and recovery

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **src/claude_mpm/services/socketio/server/core.py**
   - Added handler registration before server start
   - Call to `main_server._register_events_async()`

2. **src/claude_mpm/services/socketio/server/main.py**
   - Added `_register_events_async()` method
   - Modified startup sequence for proper initialization
   - Added safety checks for sio instance

3. **src/claude_mpm/services/socketio/server/connection_manager.py**
   - Added retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Improved error handling in `register_connection()`
   - Fixed health check timeout (90s instead of 180s)

4. **src/claude_mpm/config/socketio_config.py**
   - Reduced ping_interval to 25s
   - Reduced stale_timeout to 90s
   - Added connection_timeout parameter

5. **src/claude_mpm/services/event_bus/direct_relay.py**
   - Added retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Better broadcaster availability checking
   - Improved error handling and recovery

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/dashboard/test_dashboard_connection_fix.py`:

### Test Coverage
1. **Server Startup Test**
   - Verifies handlers registered before server starts
   - Checks all components initialized correctly
   - Validates configuration values

2. **Connection Resilience Test**
   - Tests retry logic in connection manager
   - Validates health check functionality
   - Confirms connection state tracking

3. **Event Relay Resilience Test**
   - Tests retry logic when broadcaster unavailable
   - Validates exponential backoff
   - Confirms graceful degradation

### Test Results
```
âœ… Server Startup: PASSED
âœ… Connection Resilience: PASSED  
âœ… Event Relay Resilience: PASSED

ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed! Dashboard connection fixes are working.
```

## Impact

These fixes resolve the critical dashboard connection issues by:
1. Ensuring handlers are ready when clients connect
2. Providing robust retry logic for transient failures
3. Using optimal timing configuration for stability
4. Adding resilience to all connection points

The dashboard should now maintain stable connections even under adverse conditions.
