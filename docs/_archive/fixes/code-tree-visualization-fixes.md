# Code Tree Visualization Fixes

## Date: 2025-08-28

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: D3 Visualization Not Clearing Old Nodes
**Problem**: When toggling the "Show hidden files" checkbox, the backend filtering worked correctly but the frontend D3 visualization retained old nodes (dotfiles remained visible even when they should be filtered).

**Root Cause**: The D3 visualization was not properly clearing existing SVG nodes before creating new ones when receiving new data.

**Solution**:
1. Created a new `clearD3Visualization()` method that:
   - Removes all existing `g.node` elements
   - Removes all existing `path.link` elements  
   - Resets the `nodeId` counter for proper tracking

2. Updated the "Show hidden files" checkbox event handler to call `clearD3Visualization()` before re-discovering

3. Updated the `code:top_level:discovered` event handler to call `clearD3Visualization()` before creating new nodes

### Issue 2: Visual Effects Timing
**Problem**: When clicking on a folder/file node, the visual effects (centering, size change, pulsing) were not immediately visible because they were triggered at the same time as async data loading operations.

**Root Cause**: The socket.emit calls for data loading were happening synchronously with the visual effects, causing the browser to batch the updates.

**Solution**:
1. Reorganized `onNodeClick()` method into three distinct phases:
   - **Phase 1**: Immediate visual effects (synchronous)
     - Center on node
     - Highlight with larger icon
     - Show parent context
     - Add pulsing animation
   - **Phase 2**: Data preparation (synchronous)
     - Get selected languages
     - Get ignore patterns
     - Get show hidden files setting
   - **Phase 3**: Async operations (delayed by 100ms)
     - Socket.emit for directory discovery or file analysis
     - Update breadcrumbs and notifications

2. Added a 100ms delay using `setTimeout()` before socket operations to ensure visual effects render first

## Files Modified

- `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/js/components/code-tree.js`

## Key Changes

### 1. New Method: `clearD3Visualization()`
```javascript
clearD3Visualization() {
    if (this.treeGroup) {
        console.log('[CodeTree] Clearing all D3 visualization elements');
        // Remove all existing nodes and links
        this.treeGroup.selectAll('g.node').remove();
        this.treeGroup.selectAll('path.link').remove();
    }
    // Reset node ID counter for proper tracking
    this.nodeId = 0;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Console Logging
Added comprehensive console logging to track the flow:
- `[CodeTree] Hidden files toggle changed to: <value>`
- `[CodeTree] Clearing all D3 visualization elements`
- `[CodeTree] Top-level discovered: <count> items`
- `[CodeTree] Node clicked: <name> <type>`
- `[CodeTree] Adding pulsing animation for: <name>`
- `[CodeTree] Sending discovery request for: <path>`
- `[CodeTree] Sending analysis request for: <path>`

### 3. Visual Effects Timing
Introduced a 100ms delay before socket operations to ensure visual effects are rendered first:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
    // Socket operations here
}, 100);
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test D3 Node Clearing**:
   - Load a project with dotfiles
   - Toggle "Show hidden files" off
   - Verify dotfiles disappear from visualization
   - Toggle back on
   - Verify dotfiles reappear

2. **Test Visual Effects Timing**:
   - Click on a directory node
   - Verify pulsing animation appears immediately
   - Verify centering happens before loading
   - Click on a file node
   - Verify visual effects happen before analysis

3. **Test Performance**:
   - Toggle "Show hidden files" multiple times rapidly
   - Verify no duplicate nodes appear
   - Verify memory doesn't leak (check browser dev tools)

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Visual feedback is now immediate, making the interface feel more responsive
2. **Correct Filtering**: Hidden files toggle now properly updates the visualization
3. **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging helps track issues in production
4. **Clean State Management**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks and duplicate nodes
5. **Backward Compatibility**: All changes are backward compatible with existing functionality
