# Hook Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated hook calls into the SystemPromptOrchestrator and SubprocessOrchestrator workflows. The hook service now properly loads builtin hooks and triggers them during key orchestration events.

## Changes Made

### 1. SystemPromptOrchestrator Hook Integration
**File**: `src/orchestration/system_prompt_orchestrator.py`

Added hook calls at three key points:
- **Submit Hook**: Called when processing user prompts (both interactive and non-interactive)
- **Post-Delegation Hook**: Called after Claude completes processing (captures session results)
- **Ticket Extraction**: Extracts tickets from hook results and adds them to ticket_extractor

### 2. SubprocessOrchestrator Hook Integration  
**File**: `src/orchestration/subprocess_orchestrator.py`

Added comprehensive hook integration:
- **Submit Hook**: Called when processing initial user input
- **Pre-Delegation Hook**: Called before delegating to each agent subprocess
- **Post-Delegation Hook**: Called after each agent subprocess completes

### 3. Hook Service Dynamic Loading
**File**: `src/services/hook_service.py`

Fixed the `_load_builtin_hooks()` method to actually load hook implementations:
- Uses `importlib.util` for dynamic module loading
- Finds all BaseHook subclasses in builtin hook files
- Instantiates and registers concrete hook implementations
- Properly handles abstract classes (skips them)

### 4. Ticket Extractor Enhancement
**File**: `src/orchestration/ticket_extractor.py`

Added `add_ticket()` method to support tickets extracted by hooks:
- Validates ticket has required fields (type, title)
- Adds default metadata if missing
- Integrates hook-extracted tickets with regular extraction

## Hook Execution Flow

### Interactive Mode (system_prompt_orchestrator)
1. Framework initialization → Submit hook
2. Claude processes interactively (no real-time interception possible)
3. Session ends → Post-delegation hook
4. Tickets extracted from hook results

### Non-Interactive Mode
1. User input → Submit hook
2. Claude generates response with delegations
3. Response analyzed for delegations
4. Post-delegation hook with full output
5. Tickets extracted from both response and hook results

### Subprocess Mode (subprocess_orchestrator)
1. User input → Submit hook  
2. PM generates delegations
3. For each delegation:
   - Pre-delegation hook (can modify task)
   - Agent subprocess execution
   - Post-delegation hook (can extract tickets)
4. Results aggregated

## Current Limitations

1. **Interactive Mode**: Cannot intercept Task tool delegations in real-time as they're handled internally by Claude
2. **Hook Registration**: Currently loads 4 builtin hooks automatically
3. **Task Tool Detection**: Can detect delegation patterns but cannot intercept actual Task tool execution

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify integration:
- `test_hook_integration.py`: Tests basic hook calling
- `test_hook_delegation.py`: Tests delegation-specific hooks

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Delegation Tracking**: Consider using pexpect orchestrator for better output monitoring
2. **Hook Configuration**: Add configuration file for enabling/disabling specific hooks
3. **Custom Hook Loading**: Support loading user-defined hooks from configurable directories
4. **Hook Metrics**: Track hook execution times and success rates
5. **Delegation Interception**: Explore methods to intercept actual Task tool executions
