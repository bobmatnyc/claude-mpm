**Recommendation**: 
1. Update E2E test framework for new service architecture
2. Rebuild agent discovery test harness
3. Validate agent lifecycle management integration

### 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Service Integration Gaps

**Issue**: 34% failure rate in service integration tests
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Some service interoperability issues
**Root Cause**: Agent discovery service changes, event handler refactoring

**Recommendation**:
1. Fix deployed agent discovery service
2. Update SocketIO handler tests for new architecture
3. Validate cross-service communication patterns

### 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Test Coverage Below Target

**Issue**: 19% coverage vs 70% target
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Insufficient validation of refactored code
**Root Cause**: Large refactoring with limited test updates

**Recommendation**:
1. Prioritize service layer test coverage
2. Add integration tests for memory services
3. Create performance regression test suite

## QA Sign-off and Recommendations

### **QA Status**: **CONDITIONAL PASS** ⚠️

**Rationale**: Core system functionality is solid with excellent performance and security characteristics. The DI container and service architecture refactoring is successful. However, significant test failures in agent system E2E and service integration require remediation.

### **Deployment Readiness**:

**✅ APPROVED FOR**:
- CLI operations and oneshot workflows
- Agent deployment and basic functionality
- Core service operations
- Performance-critical operations
- Security-conscious environments

**⚠️ REQUIRES FIXES FOR**:
- Complete agent system E2E workflows
- Advanced service integration scenarios
- Production monitoring and observability
- Full regression test coverage

### **Action Items Before Full Production**:

1. **HIGH PRIORITY**:
   - Fix agent system E2E test failures
   - Resolve service integration test issues
   - Update test frameworks for new architecture

2. **MEDIUM PRIORITY**:
   - Increase test coverage to 50%+ minimum
   - Add performance regression tests
   - Complete security test framework updates

3. **LOW PRIORITY**:
   - Optimize test execution times
   - Add integration testing automation
   - Create comprehensive monitoring dashboards

### **Risk Assessment**: **MEDIUM**

The system is functional for core use cases but lacks comprehensive validation for complex integration scenarios. Suitable for controlled deployment with monitoring.
