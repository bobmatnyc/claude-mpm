# Agent Memory System Documentation

The Agent Memory System in Claude MPM enables agents to learn and apply knowledge over time, creating persistent learnings that improve agent effectiveness across sessions.

Last Updated: 2025-08-06

## Overview

### What is the Memory System?

The memory system allows agents to accumulate project-specific knowledge, patterns, and learnings in persistent memory files. When agents encounter situations they've learned from before, they can apply that knowledge to make better decisions and provide more contextually relevant assistance.

### Why is it Important?

- **Continuity**: Agents remember insights across sessions, building expertise over time
- **Context-Awareness**: Agents learn project-specific patterns, conventions, and requirements
- **Efficiency**: Reduces repetitive explanations and accelerates problem-solving
- **Quality**: Agents learn from mistakes and successful patterns to improve output quality

### How Agents Learn

Agents accumulate knowledge through:
1. **Explicit Memory Commands**: Users say "remember this" or "add to memory"
2. **Auto-Learning**: Automatic extraction from agent outputs (when enabled)
3. **Project-Specific Memory Generation**: Automated analysis of project characteristics and context
4. **Documentation Building**: Enhanced extraction from dynamically discovered documentation
5. **Hook-Based Integration**: Real-time memory injection and learning extraction via hooks
6. **Manual Addition**: Direct memory file editing or CLI commands

### Benefits

**For Users:**
- Agents provide more relevant, project-specific assistance
- Reduced need to repeat context or preferences
- Faster problem resolution based on learned patterns

**For Developers:**
- Agents learn coding patterns and architectural decisions
- Reduced debugging time through learned common mistakes
- Better adherence to project conventions and standards

## Core Features

### Project-Specific Memory Generation

The memory system now automatically analyzes your project to create context-aware memories tailored to your specific codebase, technology stack, and architecture patterns.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Technology Stack Detection**: Automatically identifies languages, frameworks, and tools from configuration files
- **Architecture Pattern Recognition**: Analyzes directory structure and code patterns to understand project organization
- **Dynamic File Discovery**: Intelligently finds important documentation and configuration files
- **Agent-Specific Customization**: Generates different memory content based on the agent's role and project characteristics

**Example Project Analysis Results:**
```
claude-mpm: python CLI Application
- Main modules: cli, services, core, utils
- Uses: click, pytest, flask
- Testing: pytest fixtures
- Key patterns: Object Oriented, Async Programming
```

**Benefits:**
- **Immediate Context**: New agents start with relevant project knowledge instead of generic templates
- **Consistent Patterns**: All agents understand the same project conventions and architecture
- **Reduced Learning Time**: Agents don't need to rediscover project patterns through trial and error
- **Better Code Quality**: Agents follow established patterns from the start

### Memory Storage

Agents store memories in structured markdown files located in `.claude-mpm/memories/`:

```
.claude-mpm/memories/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ engineer_agent.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research_agent.md  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ qa_agent.md

## Usage Guide

### Adding Memories

**Natural Language (Recommended):**
```
User: "Remember that we use the src/ layout pattern for this project"
Agent: I'll remember that architectural decision for future reference.
```

**CLI Command:**
```bash
# Initialize project-specific memories (best for new projects)
claude-mpm memory init

# Add a specific learning
claude-mpm memory add engineer pattern "Use src/ layout for Python packages"

# Add a mistake to avoid
claude-mpm memory add qa error "Missing test coverage causes deployment failures"
```

**/mpm Slash Command (in interactive mode):**
```bash
# Initialize memories via PM agent
/mpm memory init

# This will trigger the PM agent to analyze your project and create memories
```

**Memory Categories:**
- `pattern`: Architectural or design patterns
- `error`: Common mistakes to avoid
- `optimization`: Performance or efficiency improvements
- `preference`: User or team preferences
- `context`: Current project state or decisions

### Viewing Memories

- **Project Documentation**: README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, architecture docs
- **Framework-Specific Docs**: API documentation, testing guides, deployment instructions
- **Code Pattern Analysis**: Extracts conventions from actual source code

### Memory Generation Examples

**Generic Memory (Old Approach):**
```markdown
## Implementation Guidelines
- Follow coding best practices
- Write comprehensive tests
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Document your code properly
```

**Project-Specific Memory (New Approach):**
```markdown
## Implementation Guidelines - React/TypeScript SPA
- Use functional components with hooks (established pattern in src/components/)
- Follow Material-UI design system conventions
- Implement unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
- Use ESLint/Prettier configuration from .eslintrc.json
- API calls through axios service layer in src/services/
- State management with Redux Toolkit (configured in src/store/)

## Current Technical Context
- Project uses TypeScript strict mode with custom tsconfig.json
- Testing: Jest with coverage reports, Cypress for E2E
- Build: Vite with custom build configurations for staging/production
- Deployment: Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
```

**Agent-Specific Variations:**

*Engineer Agent Memory:*
```markdown
## React Component Patterns
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Implement custom hooks for complex state logic
- Follow atomic design principles (atoms/molecules/organisms)
- Use React.memo for performance optimization where needed
```

*QA Agent Memory:*
```markdown
## Testing Strategy - React SPA
- Component testing: @testing-library/react with user-event
- API mocking: MSW (Mock Service Worker) for integration tests
- E2E testing: Cypress with custom commands in cypress/support/
- Coverage requirements: 80% minimum, configured in jest.config.js
```

### PM Agent Memory Command Routing

The PM agent automatically routes memory commands to appropriate agents:

**Test Routing Logic:**
```bash
claude-mpm memory route --content "Use pytest for unit testing"
```

Example output:
```
üéØ Routing Decision:
   Target Agent: qa
   Section: Testing Strategies
   Confidence: 0.87
   Reasoning: Strong match for qa agent; matched keywords: pytest, unit, testing
```

## Agent Memory Integration

### How Agents Use Memory

1. **Pre-Task Loading**: Agents load their memory before starting tasks
2. **Context Integration**: Memory content is integrated into agent prompts
3. **Decision Making**: Agents reference learned patterns and guidelines
4. **Post-Task Learning**: New insights are extracted and stored

### Real-Time Memory Updates

The memory system supports dynamic, real-time updates through multiple mechanisms:

**Hook-Based Memory Integration:**
- **PreDelegationHook**: Automatically injects relevant memories before agent execution
- **PostDelegationHook**: Extracts learnings from agent outputs after task completion
- **Context Injection**: Memories are dynamically added to agent context based on task type
- **Learning Extraction**: Agents can mark learnings in their output for automatic capture

**Programmatic Updates:**
```python
# Direct API calls for memory updates
memory_manager.update_agent_memory(agent_id, section, new_item)
memory_manager.add_learning(agent_id, learning_type, content)
```

**CLI-Based Updates:**
```bash
# Add memories on the fly
claude-mpm memory add engineer pattern "Always validate input parameters"
```

**Natural Language Updates:**
Agents recognize memory commands in conversation:
- "Remember this for next time"
- "Add this to your memory"
- "Learn from this mistake"
- "Store this insight"

### Memory Format Specification

### Memory Routing Algorithm

The routing system uses keyword analysis and pattern matching:

1. **Content Normalization**: Remove noise words, normalize spacing
2. **Agent Scoring**: Calculate relevance scores based on keyword matches
3. **Context Application**: Apply hints from task type or explicit instructions
4. **Target Selection**: Choose highest-scoring agent with confidence threshold
5. **Section Determination**: Map content type to appropriate memory section

**Agent Keyword Patterns:**
- **Engineer**: implementation, code, function, architecture, performance
- **Research**: research, analysis, findings, documentation, security
- **QA**: test, quality, bug, validation, coverage, standards
- **Documentation**: document, readme, guide, explanation, reference

### Optimization Strategies

**Duplicate Detection:**
- Exact content matching (case-insensitive)
- Similarity scoring using SequenceMatcher
- 85% similarity threshold for duplicate removal

**Consolidation Logic:**
- 70% similarity threshold for related items
- Merge strategy preserves most detailed content
- Additional context appended in parentheses

**Priority-Based Reordering:**
- High priority: critical, important, essential, must, always, never
- Medium priority: should, recommended, prefer, avoid, consider
- Low priority: note, tip, hint, example, reference

### Memory Size Management

**Size Limits:**
- Default: 8KB per memory file (~2000 tokens)
- Configurable per agent through overrides
- Auto-truncation when limits exceeded

**Section Limits:**
- Maximum 10 sections per memory file
- Maximum 15 items per section
- Maximum 120 characters per line item

**Optimization Triggers:**
- Manual optimization commands
- Automatic optimization when size limits approached
- Periodic cleanup through scheduled tasks

## Hook System Integration

### Memory Hooks Overview

The memory system integrates seamlessly with the Claude MPM hook system to provide automatic, real-time memory management:

**Available Memory Hooks:**

1. **MemoryPreDelegationHook**
   - Loads agent-specific memories before task execution
   - Injects memories as additional context in agent prompts
   - Ensures agents have access to accumulated knowledge
   - Priority: 20 (runs early in pre-delegation chain)

2. **MemoryPostDelegationHook**
   - Extracts learnings from agent outputs after task completion
   - Looks for explicit learning markers in agent responses
   - Automatically categorizes and stores new insights
   - Only active when auto_learning is enabled

### Hook Configuration

**Enable Memory Hooks:**
```yaml
# In .claude-mpm/config.yml
memory:
  enabled: true
  auto_learning: true  # Enables PostDelegationHook
  
hooks:
  memory_integration: true
```

**Hook Registration (Automatic):**
Memory hooks are automatically registered when:
- Memory system is enabled in configuration
- Claude MPM hook handler is initialized
- Agent delegation occurs

### Custom Hook Development

**Creating Custom Memory Hooks:**
```python
from claude_mpm.hooks.base_hook import PreDelegationHook, HookContext, HookResult
from claude_mpm.services.agent_memory_manager import AgentMemoryManager

class CustomMemoryHook(PreDelegationHook):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="custom_memory", priority=25)
        self.memory_manager = AgentMemoryManager()
    
    def execute(self, context: HookContext) -> HookResult:
        agent_id = context.data.get('agent')
        task_type = context.data.get('task_type')
        
        # Load task-specific memories
        if task_type == 'testing':
            qa_memory = self.memory_manager.load_agent_memory('qa')
            context.data['additional_context'] = qa_memory
        
        return HookResult(success=True, modified=True, data=context.data)
```

### Dynamic Context Injection

Hooks can inject various types of context dynamically:

**Project Context Hook Example:**
```python
class ProjectContextHook(PreDelegationHook):
    def execute(self, context: HookContext) -> HookResult:
        # Inject real-time project state
        context.data['project_context'] = {
            'current_branch': get_git_branch(),
            'recent_commits': get_recent_commits(),
            'open_issues': fetch_github_issues(),
            'deployment_status': check_deployment()
        }
        return HookResult(success=True, modified=True, data=context.data)
```

**Time-Based Context Hook:**
```python
class TimeBasedContextHook(PreDelegationHook):
    def execute(self, context: HookContext) -> HookResult:
        current_hour = datetime.now().hour
        
        # Inject time-sensitive information
        if current_hour >= 22 or current_hour < 6:
            context.data['warnings'] = "Late night - avoid production deployments"
        elif current_hour == 12:
            context.data['reminders'] = "Team standup in 30 minutes"
        
        return HookResult(success=True, modified=True, data=context.data)
```

## Best Practices

### Leveraging Project-Specific Memory Generation

**Maximizing Automatic Analysis:**
- Keep configuration files up-to-date (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Maintain clear directory structure following conventional patterns
- Document architectural decisions in discoverable locations (README.md, docs/)
- Use standard entry point files (main.py, app.js, index.ts)

**Enhancing Project Analysis:**
- Add project-specific documentation that the analyzer can discover
- Use consistent naming conventions that the analyzer can recognize
- Structure code to follow recognizable patterns (MVC, microservices, etc.)
- Include comments that describe architectural decisions and patterns

### When to Add Memories

**High-Value Situations:**
- Architectural decisions and their rationale (beyond what's auto-detected)
- Successful problem-solving patterns specific to your project context
- Common mistakes and their solutions within your tech stack
- Project-specific conventions that aren't automatically discoverable
- Performance optimizations and their impact on your specific architecture
- Integration patterns unique to your project's service combinations

**Avoid Adding:**
- Information already captured by project analysis (language, frameworks, directory structure)
- Temporary workarounds or hacks
- Generic best practices readily available in documentation
- Implementation details already evident from code patterns
- Personal preferences without team consensus

### Memory Size Guidelines

**Optimal Memory Size:**
- Keep individual items under 100 characters
- Aim for 15-20 key insights per section
- Target 70-80% of size limit for growth room
- Regular cleanup maintains relevance

**Content Quality:**
- Focus on actionable insights over descriptions
- Use clear, concise language
- Include context when patterns are non-obvious
- Prioritize learnings with broad applicability

### Categorization Tips

**Use Appropriate Sections:**
- **Architecture**: High-level design decisions
- **Guidelines**: Day-to-day implementation practices
- **Mistakes**: Known pitfalls and their solutions
- **Context**: Current project state and constraints

**Agent Assignment:**
- **Engineer**: Implementation and technical details
- **Research**: Domain knowledge and external insights
- **QA**: Quality standards and testing approaches
- **PM**: Process, coordination, and project management

### Cross-Agent Knowledge Sharing

**Identify Common Patterns:**
- Use `memory cross-ref` to find shared knowledge
- Consolidate duplicate insights across agents
- Ensure consistent terminology and approaches

**Knowledge Distribution:**
- Share architectural decisions across relevant agents
- Duplicate critical safety guidelines
- Maintain agent-specific perspectives on shared concepts

## Troubleshooting

ls -la .claude-mpm/memories/
```

**Memory Files Growing Too Large:**
```bash
# Check current usage
claude-mpm memory status

# Optimize memories
claude-mpm memory optimize

# Adjust size limits in config
# memory.limits.default_size_kb: 4
```

**Auto-Learning Not Working:**
```bash
# Enable auto-learning in config
# memory.auto_learning: true

# Check agent-specific settings
# memory.agent_overrides.engineer.auto_learning: true

# Verify memory extraction patterns
claude-mpm memory route --content "test content"
```

**Routing to Wrong Agent:**
```bash
# Test routing logic
claude-mpm memory route --content "your content here"

# Review agent patterns in memory_router.py
# Consider adding custom keywords for your domain
```

### Memory File Repair

**Corrupted Memory Files:**
```bash
# Backup existing file
cp .claude-mpm/memories/agent_agent.md agent_backup.md

# Recreate from template
rm .claude-mpm/memories/agent_agent.md
claude-mpm memory add agent context "Rebuilding memory file"
```

**Missing Memory Directory:**
```bash
# Reinitialize memory system
mkdir -p .claude-mpm/memories
claude-mpm memory status
```

### Performance Considerations

**Large Memory Files:**
- Optimize regularly to prevent size bloat
- Use agent-specific size limits for high-volume agents
- Consider memory archiving for historical data

**Slow Memory Operations:**
- Check file system permissions and disk space
- Monitor memory file sizes and section counts
- Use memory analysis to identify optimization opportunities

**Memory Build Performance:**
- Use selective rebuilding (avoid --force-rebuild)
- Process documentation files in priority order
- Monitor last-processed timestamps for efficiency

### Project Analysis Issues

**Incorrect Project Type Detection:**
```bash
# Check what the analyzer detected
python -c "
from claude_mpm.services.project_analyzer import ProjectAnalyzer
analyzer = ProjectAnalyzer()
chars = analyzer.analyze_project()
print(f'Primary Language: {chars.primary_language}')
print(f'Architecture: {chars.architecture_type}')
print(f'Frameworks: {chars.frameworks}')
"

# Force refresh analysis cache
python -c "
from claude_mpm.services.project_analyzer import ProjectAnalyzer
analyzer = ProjectAnalyzer()
chars = analyzer.analyze_project(force_refresh=True)
print(analyzer.get_project_context_summary())
"
```

**Missing Important Files:**
```bash
# Check what files the analyzer found
python -c "
from claude_mpm.services.project_analyzer import ProjectAnalyzer
analyzer = ProjectAnalyzer()
files = analyzer.get_important_files_for_context()
print('Important files found:')
for f in files: print(f'  - {f}')
"

# Ensure your important files are in standard locations
ls -la README.md package.json requirements.txt pyproject.toml
```

**Generic Memories Despite Project Analysis:**
```bash
# Check if project analysis is being used in memory creation
grep -r "project_analyzer\|ProjectAnalyzer" .claude-mpm/memories/

# Rebuild memories with fresh project analysis
claude-mpm memory build --force-rebuild
```

### Configuration Issues

**Default Settings Not Applied:**
```bash
# Verify configuration file location
ls -la .claude-mpm/config.*

# Check configuration syntax
python -c "from claude_mpm.core.config import Config; print(Config().get('memory'))"
```

**Agent-Specific Overrides Not Working:**
```yaml
# Ensure correct agent ID in config
memory:
  agent_overrides:
    engineer:  # Must match exact agent ID
      size_kb: 16
```

**Memory System Disabled:**
```yaml
# Enable in configuration
memory:
  enabled: true  # Must be explicitly true
```
