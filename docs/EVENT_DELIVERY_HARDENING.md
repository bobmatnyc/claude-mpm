# Event Delivery Hardening

## Overview

Claude MPM Dashboard now includes robust event delivery mechanisms to ensure reliable communication between the backend and frontend, even in the face of network interruptions, slow handlers, and transient failures.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Timeout Protection for SocketIO Handlers

All async event handlers now have timeout protection to prevent resource leaks and hanging connections:

- **Default timeout**: 5 seconds for most handlers, 3 seconds for simpler operations
- **Graceful failure**: Handlers that timeout log the error and return gracefully
- **Client notification**: Timeout errors are sent to the client when possible
- **Performance warnings**: Handlers close to timeout threshold trigger warnings

```python
@timeout_handler(timeout_seconds=5.0)
async def handle_event(sid, data):
    # Handler code protected by timeout
    pass
```

### 2. Client-Side Socket Resilience

The dashboard JavaScript client now includes comprehensive resilience features:

#### Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
- Failed event emissions are retried up to 3 times
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s between retries
- Configurable per-emission retry behavior

```javascript
socketClient.emitWithRetry('event_name', data, {
    maxRetries: 3,
    retryDelays: [1000, 2000, 4000],
    onSuccess: () => console.log('Sent'),
    onFailure: (reason) => console.error('Failed:', reason)
});
```

#### Event Queue During Disconnection
- Events emitted while disconnected are queued (max 100 events)
- Queue is flushed automatically upon reconnection
- FIFO processing with 100ms spacing between events

#### Connection State Monitoring
- Tracks connection uptime and disconnect duration
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Connection metrics available via `getConnectionMetrics()`

### 3. Server-Side Event Retry Queue

Failed broadcasts are now queued for retry with intelligent backoff:

#### RetryQueue Implementation
- Maximum 3 retry attempts per event
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s (max)
- Events older than 30 seconds are abandoned
- Queue size limited to 1000 events

#### Retry Processor
- Background task processes retry queue every 2 seconds
- Failed broadcasts automatically added to queue
- Comprehensive statistics tracking

```python
# Retry queue statistics
{
    'queued': 10,      # Total events queued
    'retried': 5,      # Total retry attempts
    'succeeded': 4,    # Successful retries
    'abandoned': 1,    # Events that exceeded limits
    'queue_size': 0    # Current queue size
}
```

### 4. WebSocket Health Monitoring

Active health monitoring ensures dead connections are detected and cleaned:

#### Server-Side Health Checks
- **Ping/Pong mechanism**: Server pings clients every 30 seconds
- **Stale detection**: Connections without pong response for 40s are cleaned
- **Connection metrics**: Tracks uptime, reconnects, and failures per client
- **Automatic cleanup**: Stale connections are forcibly disconnected

#### Client-Side Health Monitoring
- **Ping response**: Clients automatically respond to server pings
- **Stale detection**: No ping for 40s triggers reconnection
- **Health check interval**: Every 10 seconds
- **Forced reconnection**: Automatic recovery from stale state

## Configuration

### Server Configuration

```python
# In ConnectionEventHandler
self.ping_interval = 30        # Seconds between pings
self.ping_timeout = 10         # Seconds to wait for pong
self.stale_check_interval = 60 # Seconds between stale checks

# In SocketIOEventBroadcaster
self.retry_interval = 2.0      # Seconds between retry processing
```

### Client Configuration

```javascript
// In SocketClient constructor
this.maxRetryAttempts = 3;
this.retryDelays = [1000, 2000, 4000];  // Milliseconds
this.maxQueueSize = 100;
this.pingTimeout = 40000;  // Milliseconds
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: Events are delivered even during transient network issues
2. **Resource Protection**: Timeouts prevent resource leaks from hanging handlers
3. **Better User Experience**: Automatic reconnection and event replay
4. **Operational Visibility**: Comprehensive metrics and logging for debugging
5. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues functioning during partial failures

## Monitoring

### Server Logs

Monitor these log patterns for health status:

```
üèì Sent pings to X clients, Y failed
üßü Detected stale connection sid_xxx
üßπ Cleaned up X stale connections
üîÑ Processing X events from retry queue
üìä Retry queue stats - queued: X, retried: Y, succeeded: Z
```

### Client Metrics

Access real-time metrics via browser console:

```javascript
socketClient.getConnectionMetrics()
// Returns:
{
    isConnected: true,
    uptime: 245.3,         // seconds
    lastPing: 5.2,         // seconds ago
    queuedEvents: 0,
    pendingEmissions: 0,
    retryAttempts: 0
}
```

## Backward Compatibility

All enhancements are backward compatible:
- Existing event handlers continue to work
- Default timeouts applied to all handlers
- Client enhancements are opt-in via `emitWithRetry()`
- Standard `socket.emit()` still works without retry

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for retry queue logic
- Tests for timeout decorator behavior
- Integration tests for health monitoring
- End-to-end tests for event delivery

Run tests with:
```bash
pytest tests/test_event_delivery.py -v
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Configurable timeout values per handler
- Priority queue for critical events
- Circuit breaker pattern for persistent failures
- Event deduplication
- Persistent event storage for critical events
