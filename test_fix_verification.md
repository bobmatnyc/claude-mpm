# Browser Logs Tab Hook Event Isolation Fix Verification

## Problem
Hook events (like `[hook] hook.pre_tool`, `[hook] hook.post_tool`) were appearing in the Browser Logs tab, which should only show browser console logs.

## Root Cause
The `browser-log-viewer.js` component was accepting any log entry that had either a `browser_id` OR a `message` field. Since hook events have a `message` field, they were passing validation and appearing in Browser Logs.

## Fix Applied
Modified `/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/js/components/browser-log-viewer.js`:

1. **Strict Validation**: Now REQUIRES `browser_id` field to accept a log entry
   - Only true browser console logs have `browser_id`
   - Hook events do NOT have `browser_id`, so they are filtered out

2. **Extra Socket Validation**: Added validation at the WebSocket listener level
   - Checks for `browser_id` before processing events
   - Logs warnings for rejected events

3. **Cleanup**: Added proper cleanup in destroy() method for both event listeners

## Code Changes

### Before (Problem)
```javascript
if (!logEntry.browser_id && !logEntry.message) {
    // This would accept entries with just message field
    console.warn('[BrowserLogViewer] Ignoring non-browser log entry:', logEntry);
    return;
}
```

### After (Fixed)
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Only accept entries with browser_id field
if (!logEntry.browser_id) {
    console.warn('[BrowserLogViewer] Rejecting non-browser log (missing browser_id):', logEntry);
    return;
}
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check the Fix is Deployed
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8765/static/js/components/browser-log-viewer.js | grep "CRITICAL: Only accept"
```
✅ Should show: "CRITICAL: Only accept entries with browser_id field"

### 2. Manual Browser Verification
1. Open http://localhost:8765 in your browser
2. Open browser Developer Console (F12)
3. Click on "Browser Logs" tab in the dashboard
4. Run some tool commands to trigger hook events
5. Verify:
   - Browser Logs tab remains empty or shows only true browser console logs
   - Events/Hooks tab shows the hook events
   - No `[hook]` prefixed events in Browser Logs

### 3. Console Output
In the browser console, you should see:
- `[BrowserLogViewer] Rejecting non-browser log (missing browser_id): {type: "hook.pre_tool"...}`
- This confirms hook events are being properly rejected

## Test Results

### Hook Event Isolation Test
✅ Hook events no longer appear in Browser Logs tab
✅ Hook events correctly appear only in Events/Hooks tab
✅ Browser logs with proper `browser_id` are still accepted
✅ Validation works at both addLog() and WebSocket listener levels

### Server Endpoints
- `/api/browser-log` - POST endpoint for browser console logs
- Requires: `browser_id`, `level`, `message` fields
- Hook events lacking `browser_id` are rejected by client

## Falsifiable Success Criteria Met
1. ✅ Browser Logs tab shows ZERO hook events
2. ✅ Only logs with browser_id and proper browser format appear
3. ✅ Hook events stay exclusively in Events/Hooks tab
4. ✅ Test with actual hook activity confirms no contamination
5. ✅ Browser console logs (when properly injected) still work correctly

## Summary
The fix successfully isolates browser console logs from hook events by:
1. Requiring `browser_id` field for all browser logs
2. Rejecting any events without `browser_id` at multiple levels
3. Maintaining proper separation between event types in the UI

The Browser Logs tab is now clean and only shows actual browser console output when the browser monitor is injected.
