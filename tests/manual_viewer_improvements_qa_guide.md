# Manual QA Testing Guide: Viewer Improvements

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step manual testing procedures to validate the viewer improvements implemented in the Claude MPM dashboard.

## Original Requirements
1. **VIEWER should be in the blue file path bar** - Users should be able to click the blue file path bar to open a file browser overlay
2. **DIFF viewer should be attached to each EDIT tool use** - Each Edit/MultiEdit event should have an inline diff viewer showing only the changes for that specific edit

## Pre-Testing Setup

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Ensure the dashboard is running
cd /Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm
python -m claude_mpm.dashboard.server

# Open browser and navigate to dashboard
# URL: http://localhost:8765
```

### 2. Generate Test Data (if needed)
To properly test Edit diff viewers, you need Edit/MultiEdit events. Run some file operations:
```bash
# Create test file operations to generate Edit events
echo "original content" > test_file.txt
# Then make some edits using Claude with Edit tool
```
