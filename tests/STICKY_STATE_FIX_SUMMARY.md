# Dashboard Sticky State Fix Summary

## Problem
The "Full Event Data" section in the dashboard was not maintaining its sticky state (expanded/collapsed) across events and page refreshes, while the "Structured Data" section was working properly.

## Root Cause
Both sections were using the same localStorage key (`'dashboard-json-expanded'`), causing them to share state instead of maintaining independent states.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added Separate State for Full Event Data**
   - Created new localStorage key: `'dashboard-full-event-expanded'`
   - Added separate state variable: `this.fullEventDataExpanded`
   - Added new event: `'fullEventToggleChanged'`

### 2. **Updated unified-data-viewer.js**
   - Added `fullEventDataExpanded` state property
   - Created `toggleFullEventSection()` method for Full Event Data sections
   - Created `updateAllFullEventSections()` method for syncing Full Event sections
   - Modified `createCollapsibleJSON()` to detect section type and use appropriate state
   - Added logic to differentiate between "Structured Data" and "Full Event Data" sections

### 3. **Updated module-viewer.js**
   - Added `fullEventDataExpanded` state property
   - Added listener for `'fullEventToggleChanged'` events
   - Synchronized state between module-viewer and unified-data-viewer

### 4. **Fixed Syntax Error in code-tree.js**
   - Removed duplicate closing brace in `isTextFile()` method (line 5546)
   - Removed invalid cache buster comment at end of file

## Files Modified
1. `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/js/components/unified-data-viewer.js`
2. `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/js/components/module-viewer.js`
3. `/Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm/src/claude_mpm/dashboard/static/js/components/code-tree.js`

## How It Works Now
- **Structured Data sections** use `localStorage['dashboard-json-expanded']`
- **Full Event Data sections** use `localStorage['dashboard-full-event-expanded']`
- Each section type maintains its own sticky state independently
- States persist across:
  - Event selections
  - Page refreshes
  - Different browser tabs (same domain)

## Testing
Created test files to verify the fix:
- `test-sticky-state.html` - Interactive test page for verifying independent states
- `test-dashboard-sticky.py` - Test script with manual verification instructions

## Verification Steps
1. Open dashboard at http://localhost:8080
2. Click on any event in the Activity tab
3. Toggle "Structured Data" section - note its state
4. Toggle "Full Event Data" section - note its state
5. Switch to a different event - both sections should maintain their states
6. Refresh the page - both sections should maintain their states
7. Toggle one section - the other should remain unchanged
