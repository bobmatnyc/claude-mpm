# Code Tab Redesign Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. UI Changes in `index.html`
- **Removed from top bar:**
  - Path input field (`analysis-path`)
  - Analyze button (`analyze-code`)
  - Cancel button (`cancel-analysis`)

- **Advanced Options:**
  - Changed from collapsible `<details>` element to always-visible `<div>`
  - TypeScript checkbox is now checked by default (along with Python and JavaScript)
  - Removed the Depth input field completely
  - Kept the Ignore patterns input with expanded placeholder text

### 2. JavaScript Changes in `code-tree.js`

#### New Behavior:
- **Automatic Discovery:** When Code tab is opened, automatically triggers `autoDiscoverRootLevel()`
- **Project Root Node:** Creates "Project Root" as the top-level tree item
- **Auto-expansion:** Root node starts expanded to show discovered items
- **Lazy Loading:** 
  - Clicking a directory triggers `code:discover:directory` event
  - Clicking a file triggers `code:analyze:file` event
  - Loading states shown on individual nodes

#### Key Methods Modified:
- `constructor()`: Added `autoDiscovered` flag to track if auto-discovery has run
- `initialize()`: Now calls `autoDiscoverRootLevel()` when tab is active
- `renderWhenVisible()`: Also triggers auto-discovery if not done yet
- `autoDiscoverRootLevel()`: New method that automatically discovers root-level items
- `setupControls()`: Removed handlers for analyze and cancel buttons
- `onNodeClick()`: Enhanced to include language filters and ignore patterns in discovery requests

#### Event Handlers Added:
- `code:top_level:discovered`: Handles the response from root-level discovery
- `code:directory:contents`: Enhanced to properly handle lazy-loaded directory contents

### 3. CSS Changes in `code-tree.css`
- Added `.code-advanced-options-visible` class for always-visible advanced options
- Styled the advanced options to be a clean, horizontal layout
- Preserved all existing tree visualization styles

## Socket.IO Events Used

### Emitted Events:
- `code:discover:top_level` - Triggered automatically when Code tab opens
- `code:discover:directory` - Triggered when user clicks on a directory
- `code:analyze:file` - Triggered when user clicks on a file

### Listened Events:
- `code:top_level:discovered` - Receives discovered root-level items
- `code:directory:contents` - Receives directory contents for lazy loading
- `code:file:analyzed` - Receives AST analysis results for files

## User Experience Flow

1. **Tab Opening:**
   - User clicks on "Code" tab
   - System automatically discovers root-level directories and files
   - "Project Root" node appears with discovered items as children

2. **Exploration:**
   - User clicks on a directory → System loads its contents
   - User clicks on a file → System analyzes its AST
   - Loading indicators show on individual nodes during operations

3. **Filtering:**
   - Language checkboxes filter what gets discovered/analyzed
   - TypeScript is enabled by default (along with Python and JavaScript)
   - Ignore patterns prevent specified files/directories from being discovered

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the implementation:
```bash
python test_code_tab_redesign.py
```

Or manually:
1. Start the dashboard: `./scripts/claude-mpm dashboard`
2. Open browser to http://localhost:8765
3. Click on the "Code" tab
4. Verify automatic discovery occurs
5. Click on directories/files to test lazy loading

## Benefits

1. **Improved UX:** No manual trigger needed - exploration starts automatically
2. **Better Performance:** Lazy loading means only requested data is fetched
3. **Cleaner Interface:** Removed unnecessary controls, kept only what's needed
4. **Smart Defaults:** TypeScript enabled by default as requested
5. **Intuitive Navigation:** Click to explore, just like a file browser
