description: 'Deploy the claude-mpm Python multi-agent project management framework
  to Railway platform.


  **Project Context:**

  - Python application (v3.11+) with Flask/SocketIO backend

  - Uses pyproject.toml for configuration

  - Modern service-oriented architecture with 5 service domains

  - WebSocket server for real-time communication (ports 8765-8785)

  - Includes CLI tool and web dashboard

  - Current project structure under /Users/masa/Projects/claude-mpm


  **Deployment Requirements:**

  1. Analyze current project structure and identify deployment needs

  2. Create Railway configuration files (railway.json/railway.toml)

  3. Configure build and start commands for Python application

  4. Set up environment variables and required services

  5. Handle Python dependencies from pyproject.toml

  6. Configure SocketIO server and web dashboard for Railway

  7. Set up any required Railway services (database, Redis if needed)

  8. Deploy and verify all services start correctly


  **Key Considerations:**

  - Both CLI and web components need proper configuration

  - SocketIO server needs proper port configuration

  - Static files and assets handling

  - Health checks configuration

  - Environment variable management

  - Service discovery for multi-service architecture


  **Expected Deliverables:**

  - Complete Railway configuration files

  - Deployment instructions

  - Environment variable setup guide

  - Verification steps for successful deployment

  - Documentation for future deployments'
