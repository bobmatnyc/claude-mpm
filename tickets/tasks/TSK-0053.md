# Phase 4: Update documentation for refactored architecture

## Description
Update all documentation to reflect the new service architecture, improved dependency injection system, and performance optimizations implemented in phases 1-3

## Details
- **Status**: âœ… completed
- **Priority**: medium
- **Assignees**: Documentation Agent
- **Tags**: source:claude-mpm-cli, task, auto-extracted
- **Created**: 2025-08-13 23:55:23
- **Updated**: 2025-08-14 12:00:00

## Tasks
- [x] Create Architecture Overview (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [x] Create Service Layer Guide (docs/developer/SERVICES.md)  
- [x] Create Performance Guide (docs/PERFORMANCE.md)
- [x] Create Security Guide (docs/SECURITY.md)
- [x] Create Testing Guide (docs/TESTING.md)
- [x] Create Migration Guide (docs/MIGRATION.md)
- [x] Update README.md with new architecture information
- [x] Update STRUCTURE.md with new directory organization
- [x] Update QA.md with new testing procedures
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with refactoring achievements

## Documentation Deliverables

### New Documentation Created
1. **[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Comprehensive service-oriented architecture overview
2. **[docs/developer/SERVICES.md](../docs/developer/SERVICES.md)** - Complete service layer development guide  
3. **[docs/PERFORMANCE.md](../docs/PERFORMANCE.md)** - Performance optimization and caching strategies
4. **[docs/SECURITY.md](../docs/SECURITY.md)** - Security framework and best practices
5. **[docs/TESTING.md](../docs/TESTING.md)** - Testing patterns and comprehensive strategies
6. **[docs/MIGRATION.md](../docs/MIGRATION.md)** - Migration guide from legacy architecture

### Updated Documentation
1. **[README.md](../README.md)** - Added architecture section and updated documentation links
2. **[docs/STRUCTURE.md](../docs/STRUCTURE.md)** - Updated with new service organization
3. **[docs/QA.md](../docs/QA.md)** - Enhanced with service architecture testing procedures
4. **[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** - Updated development guidelines with refactoring achievements

## Architecture Coverage

The documentation comprehensively covers:

- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Five specialized service domains
- **Interface-Based Contracts**: All service interfaces and implementations
- **Dependency Injection System**: Service container and resolution patterns
- **Performance Optimizations**: Lazy loading, caching, and connection pooling
- **Security Framework**: Input validation, path sanitization, and secure operations
- **Testing Strategies**: Unit, integration, E2E, performance, and security testing
- **Migration Paths**: Backward compatibility and upgrade instructions

## Performance and Quality Metrics

- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% of refactored components documented
- **Architecture Accuracy**: All service relationships and interfaces documented
- **Migration Support**: Complete upgrade path from legacy architecture
- **Developer Experience**: Comprehensive guides for all development scenarios
- **Code Examples**: Practical examples for all major patterns

## Notes

**Completed**: Comprehensive documentation update for TSK-0053 service layer architecture refactoring. All documentation reflects the new service-oriented architecture with interface-based contracts, dependency injection, performance optimizations, and security enhancements. Backward compatibility is maintained while providing clear migration paths for future development.
