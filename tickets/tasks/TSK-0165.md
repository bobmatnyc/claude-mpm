  tested_comment: 'Successfully implemented /mpm-doctor command for Claude Code interactive
    mode. The command:

    - Recognizes /mpm-doctor and /mpm-doctor --verbose in interactive mode

    - Runs the same DiagnosticRunner as ''claude-mpm doctor''

    - Formats output appropriately for terminal display

    - Updated welcome message to show available commands

    - Added comprehensive tests that all pass

    - Updated documentation in docs/user/basic-usage.md


    Note: The command is prepared for future enhancement where claude-mpm could intercept
    commands, but currently works within the existing interactive session framework.'
