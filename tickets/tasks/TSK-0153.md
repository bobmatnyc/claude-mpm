description: 'The Socket.IO server port has been changed from 8080 to 8765 in the

  Technical Context:

  - Port migration from 8080 → 8765 as new default

  - Need to check for existing instances on multiple ports to avoid conflicts

  - Verify configuration files are using correct port settings

  - Ensure service starts cleanly with new port configuration


  Success Criteria:

  - All old server instances properly terminated

  - New server running stable on port 8765
