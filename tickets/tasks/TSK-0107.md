# Verify Event Parsing Fix in Dashboard

## Description
Comprehensive verification that the dashboard event parsing fix is working correctly and events are no longer showing as "unknown".

## Dashboard URL
http://localhost:8765/

## Verification Tasks:

### 1. Check Current Dashboard State
- Open http://localhost:8765/
- Take a screenshot of the events currently displayed
- Note how events are labeled (should NOT be "unknown")

### 2. Verify Test Events Just Sent
We just sent these 4 test events:
1. **Hook event with conflicting type in data** - Should show as "hook.test" NOT "unknown"
2. **Legacy TestEvent** - Should show as "TestEvent" NOT "unknown"  
3. **Hook UserPrompt** - Should show as "hook.UserPrompt" NOT "unknown"
4. **System status event** - Should show as "system.status" NOT "unknown"

### 3. Generate Additional Test Events
Send more events to thoroughly test edge cases and different event types.

### 4. Check All Dashboard Tabs
Verify events are categorized correctly in:
- **Events Tab**: All events visible with proper names
- **Tools Tab**: ToolCall events appear here
- **Agents Tab**: SubagentStart events appear here
- **Files Tab**: File-related events if any

### 5. Browser Console Check
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Check for any JavaScript errors
- Look for console.log outputs showing event transformation
- Verify no "unknown" type assignments in logs

### 6. Visual Verification
Take screenshots showing:
- Events with proper type labels (not "unknown")
- Different event types displaying correctly
- Tool and agent events in respective tabs
- No parsing errors in display

### 7. Performance Check
- Are events updating in real-time?
- Is the dashboard responsive?
- Are timestamps correct?

## Success Criteria
✅ **PASS** if:
- No events show as "unknown" (except truly unknown formats)
- All test events display with correct types
- Events are properly categorized in tabs
- No JavaScript errors in console

❌ **FAIL** if:
- Any standard event shows as "unknown"
- Events lose their type information
- JavaScript errors occur
- Events don't appear in correct tabs

## Deliverables:
- Screenshots of dashboard showing proper event types
- Confirmation that fix is working
- Any remaining issues found
- Browser console output if relevant
