# QA: Verify Simplified Output Style Implementation

## Description
**Context**: The Engineer simplified the output style implementation by removing periodic enforcement and continuous monitoring. Only one-time setup at startup remains.

**Files Modified**:
1. `src/claude_mpm/core/output_style_manager.py` - Removed enforcement methods
2. `src/claude_mpm/core/interactive_session.py` - Removed enforcement calls  
3. `src/claude_mpm/core/framework_loader.py` - Simplified logging

**Testing Requirements**:

1. **One-Time Setup Testing**:
   - Verify style is deployed and activated once at startup
   - Confirm no periodic checking occurs during runtime
   - Test that style settings are applied correctly at initialization

2. **No Monitoring Verification**:
   - Confirm no periodic file I/O operations
   - Verify no enforcement-related background processes
   - Check that no continuous monitoring threads are created

3. **User Changes Respected**:
   - Test that user manual style changes persist
   - Verify changes are not overridden by system
   - Confirm user preference takes precedence

4. **Clean Startup Testing**:
   - Verify no enforcement warning messages appear
   - Check startup logs are clean and minimal
   - Confirm no error messages related to style enforcement

5. **Performance Verification**:
   - Measure startup time impact (should be minimal)
   - Verify no ongoing file I/O after initialization
   - Check memory usage is reasonable

**Expected Behavior**:
- Style is deployed and activated once at startup only
- No warning messages about enforcement
- No periodic checking or file operations
- User changes are respected and not overridden
- Clean, minimal logging during startup

**Test Approach**:
1. Create comprehensive test script covering all scenarios
2. Test actual startup behavior in real environment
3. Monitor file I/O and system resources during runtime
4. Verify user interaction scenarios work correctly
5. Run integration tests with the simplified implementation

**Success Criteria**:
- All tests pass showing one-time setup works
- No periodic monitoring detected
- User changes are preserved
- Clean startup with minimal logging
- No performance degradation
