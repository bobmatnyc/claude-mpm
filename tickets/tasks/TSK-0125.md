# QA Testing: Memory Aggregation System with Bullet-Point Format

## Description
Test the newly modified memory aggregation system that now supports simple bullet-point format without requiring section headers.

**Changes Made by Engineer:**
- Modified `_aggregate_memories()` method in `src/claude_mpm/core/framework_loader.py`
- Added support for simple bullet-point memories (lines starting with `-`)
- Maintained backward compatibility with sectioned format
- Created test suite in `tests/test_memory_aggregation.py`

**Testing Requirements:**

1. **Run the test suite**:
   - Execute the new test file `tests/test_memory_aggregation.py`
   - Verify all 9 tests pass
   - Check test coverage for the aggregation logic

2. **Integration testing**:
   - Test that the framework loader properly uses the new aggregation
   - Verify memories are correctly loaded and injected into PM instructions
   - Test with actual memory files in both user and project directories

3. **Format validation**:
   - Simple bullets only (no sections)
   - Sections with bullets
   - Mixed format (bullets before/after sections)
   - Empty files
   - Files with only comments

4. **Deduplication testing**:
   - Verify duplicate memories are properly handled
   - Test project memories override user memories for duplicates
   - Ensure unique memories from both sources are preserved

5. **Edge cases**:
   - Malformed bullets
   - Extra whitespace
   - Unicode characters in memories
   - Very long memory lines

Please provide comprehensive test results including:
- Test results and coverage
- Any issues or failures found
- Performance impact (if any)
- Confirmation that the system works as expected
