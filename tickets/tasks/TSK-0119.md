# QA: Test Memory Loading Fixes and Enhancements

## Description
Execute comprehensive testing of the memory loading fixes and enhancements in claude-mpm.

## Test Scenarios Required:

### 1. Duplicate Loading Fix Verification
- Run `./claude-mpm run` and verify "Loaded PM memories from:" appears only ONCE in logs
- Previously appeared 2-4 times due to SystemInstructionsService not caching FrameworkLoader

### 2. Agent Memory Loading Validation
- Check deployed agents in `.claude/agents/`
- Create test memory files in `.claude-mpm/memories/` for both deployed and non-deployed agents
- Verify:
  - Deployed agent memories are loaded with clear log messages
  - Non-deployed agent memories are skipped with explanation
  - Proper agent deployment verification logic

### 3. Memory Summary Accuracy
- Validate summary log: "Memory loading complete: X memories loaded, Y skipped"
- Ensure counts accurately reflect actual loading behavior

### 4. Configuration Testing
Test various memory configurations:
- No memory files present
- Only PM.md exists
- PM.md + various agent memory files
- Mixed deployed/non-deployed agents with memories
- Edge cases with malformed memory files

### 5. Unit Test Execution
Run specific unit tests to prevent regressions:
```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_framework_loader.py -xvs
pytest tests/unit/test_system_instructions_service.py -xvs
```

### 6. Performance and Caching Validation
- Verify SystemInstructionsService properly caches FrameworkLoader instance
- Confirm enhanced memory logging doesn't impact startup performance
- Validate memory loading happens efficiently

## Expected Outcomes:
- All duplicate loading issues resolved
- Clear, comprehensive memory loading logs
- Proper agent deployment verification
- No performance regressions
- All unit tests passing

## Deliverables:
- Test execution results for each scenario
- Performance impact assessment
- Issue identification and documentation
- Recommendations for any additional fixes needed
