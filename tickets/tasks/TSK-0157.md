# Ops Agent: Fix localhost:8765 ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED

## Description
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE: User cannot access dashboard at localhost:8765 due to ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED error.

REQUIRED INVESTIGATION AND FIXES:

1. **Process Investigation**:
   - Check ALL running claude-mpm related processes using ps, pgrep
   - Verify status of previously started processes (PIDs 38521, 39084 mentioned)
   - Identify any zombie or hung processes that need cleanup

2. **Port Analysis**:
   - Use netstat/lsof to check what's listening on port 8765
   - Identify any port conflicts or processes blocking the port
   - Verify port binding status and accessibility

3. **Server Status Verification**:
   - Check if Socket.IO server is running properly
   - Verify dashboard web server status
   - Review any server logs for error messages or crash indicators

4. **Network Testing**:
   - Test with curl http://localhost:8765 to get actual response
   - Verify local network connectivity
   - Check for firewall or permission issues

5. **Service Recovery**:
   - Kill any zombie/hung processes if found
   - Restart claude-mpm servers using proper commands:
     - Socket.IO server startup
     - Dashboard web server startup
   - Ensure both services start successfully and bind to correct ports

6. **Verification and Testing**:
   - Confirm servers are listening on port 8765
   - Test dashboard accessibility with multiple methods
   - Verify full functionality of claude-mpm dashboard

CONTEXT: This is blocking user access to the claude-mpm dashboard. The user has experienced persistent connection refused errors despite previous attempts to start servers.

EXPECTED OUTCOME: Working dashboard accessible at http://localhost:8765 with full functionality.
