# Verify Agent Version Checking System Implementation

## Description
Based on Research findings, execute comprehensive testing of the agent version checking system to verify:

## Test Categories Required:

### 1. Version Comparison Tests
- Verify semantic version comparison works correctly
- Test that 3.5.0 > 3.4.9 
- Test that 2.0.0 > 1.9.9
- Test that 3.5.0 = 3.5.0
- Verify pre-release version handling if applicable

### 2. Upgrade Detection Tests  
- Simulate scenarios where agents need upgrading
- Test with lower deployed version vs higher template version
- Verify equal versions don't trigger updates
- Test that higher deployed versions aren't downgraded

### 3. Source and Version Persistence
- Deploy an agent and verify version is saved correctly
- Check that subsequent checks show agent as up-to-date
- Verify source information persists with version

### 4. Edge Cases
- Test with missing version fields
- Test with malformed version strings
- Test migration from old format to new format

### 5. Multi-Source Resolution
- If multiple sources have same agent, verify highest version wins
- Test source change detection

## System Context (from Research):
- Version comparison uses semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- Properly compares versions as tuples
- Handles migration from old formats
- Prevents downgrades
- Only updates when explicitly triggered (not automatic on startup)

## Expected Results:
- Version comparison follows semantic versioning rules
- Agents only upgrade when template version > deployed version
- No downgrades occur
- Version and source information persist correctly
- System handles edge cases gracefully

Focus specifically on the version checking logic and provide comprehensive test results with any issues identified.
