description: 'Test the dashboard at http://localhost:8766/ to verify that the event
  parsing fix is working correctly and events are displaying with proper types instead
  of "unknown".


  ## Test Requirements:


  ### 1. Initial Dashboard Load

  - Open dashboard at http://localhost:8766/

  - Verify page loads without errors

  - Check WebSocket connection establishes successfully

  - Look for JavaScript console errors


  ### 2. Generate Test Events

  Use the provided Python script to generate various event types:

  - test events

  - hook events (user_prompt subtype)

  - session events (started subtype)

  - subagent events (completed subtype)

  - system events (heartbeat)


  ### 3. Verify Event Display

  Check that events display with correct types:

  - "test" for test events

  - "hook.user_prompt" for hook events

  - "session.started" for session events

  - "subagent.completed" for subagent events

  - "system.heartbeat" for heartbeat events

  - NO events should show as "unknown"


  ### 4. Check Cached Events

  - Refresh browser and verify cached events load

  - Confirm event types remain correct after refresh


  ### 5. Monitor System Heartbeat

  - Wait for automatic heartbeat events (up to 60 seconds)

  - Verify they show as "system" type


  ## Deliverables:

  - Screenshots showing correct event types

  - Confirmation that no "unknown" events appear

  - Any remaining issues or performance observations

  - Browser console error logs if any'
