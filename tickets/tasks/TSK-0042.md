# Implement service layer interfaces

## Description
Define clear interfaces for all services to improve modularity and testability. Assigned to Engineer Agent.

## Details
- **Status**: completed
- **Priority**: high
- **Assignees**: None
- **Tags**: task, source:ticket-cli, architecture, engineer-agent, auto-extracted, service-layer, in-progress, phase2
- **Created**: 2025-08-13 21:16:42

## Tasks
- [x] Create abstract interfaces in src/claude_mpm/core/interfaces.py

- [x] Add HookServiceInterface for hook execution operations
- [x] Add SocketIOServiceInterface for WebSocket communication
- [x] Add ProjectAnalyzerInterface for project analysis operations
- [x] Add TicketManagerInterface for ticket management operations
- [x] Update AgentDeploymentService to inherit from AgentDeploymentInterface
- [x] Update AgentMemoryManager to inherit from MemoryServiceInterface
- [x] Update HookService to inherit from HookServiceInterface
- [x] Update SocketIOServer to inherit from SocketIOServiceInterface
- [x] Update ProjectAnalyzer to inherit from ProjectAnalyzerInterface
- [x] Update TicketManager to inherit from TicketManagerInterface

## Notes
**Completed on 2025-08-14**

Successfully implemented service layer interfaces for all major services in the claude-mpm framework:

1. **Created Interfaces**: Added 6 new service interfaces to `/src/claude_mpm/core/interfaces.py`:
   - `AgentDeploymentInterface` - Standardizes agent deployment operations
   - `MemoryServiceInterface` - Defines memory management contract
   - `HookServiceInterface` - Establishes hook execution patterns
   - `SocketIOServiceInterface` - WebSocket/real-time communication
   - `ProjectAnalyzerInterface` - Project analysis and inspection
   - `TicketManagerInterface` - Ticket/task management operations

2. **Updated Services**: All concrete service implementations now inherit from their respective interfaces:
   - Services that already had compatible methods use their existing implementations
   - Services with incompatible signatures have adapter methods to maintain backward compatibility
   - All interfaces use proper type hints for better IDE support and type checking

3. **Benefits Achieved**:
   - Reduced tight coupling between services
   - Enabled easier testing with mock implementations
   - Improved dependency injection capabilities
   - Made the architecture more maintainable and extensible
   - Established clear contracts for service interactions
