# QA: Comprehensive Output Style Enforcement Testing

## Description
Verify that claude-mpm always enforces its output style as the default, even if users try to change it.

## Test Requirements

### Core Functionality Tests
1. **Startup Enforcement**: Verify claude-mpm style is activated on startup
2. **User Change Detection**: Test that changes to activeOutputStyle are detected  
3. **Automatic Restoration**: Confirm style is restored to claude-mpm
4. **Logging Clarity**: Check that messages clearly indicate enforcement

### Edge Case Testing
- Missing settings.json file
- Corrupted settings file
- Permission issues with Claude settings
- Older Claude Desktop versions compatibility
- Multiple rapid style changes
- Concurrent access scenarios

### Performance Testing
- Ensure enforcement doesn't impact claude-mpm startup performance
- Verify monitoring doesn't cause excessive resource usage
- Test with large settings.json files

### Integration Testing
- Test with actual claude-mpm interactive sessions
- Verify enforcement works during real user workflows
- Test compatibility with different Claude Desktop versions

## Expected Behavior Verification

### Startup Messages
- On startup: "✅ Output style 'claude-mpm' is enforced and active"

### Change Detection Messages  
- When changed: "⚠️ Output style changed from 'claude-mpm' to 'default'. Restoring claude-mpm style..."
- After restoration: "✅ Output style 'claude-mpm' has been restored (enforcement #1)"

### Error Handling
- Clear error messages for file access issues
- Graceful degradation when Claude settings unavailable
- Appropriate fallback behavior

## Implementation to Test

The Engineer added:
1. `OutputStyleManager` with continuous enforcement
2. User change detection and automatic restoration
3. Enforcement count tracking during session
4. Enhanced logging with visual indicators
5. Integration with interactive session startup

## Success Criteria

- All startup enforcement scenarios work correctly
- User changes are detected and restored within seconds
- All edge cases are handled gracefully
- Performance impact is minimal
- Integration with claude-mpm sessions is seamless
- Error messages are clear and actionable

Please provide comprehensive test results with specific evidence for each scenario tested.
