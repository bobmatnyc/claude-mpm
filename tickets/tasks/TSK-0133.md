description: 'Migrate MCP Gateway services to use the new service base classes.


  ## Services to Migrate

  - MCPGatewayService

  - MCPConfigurationService

  - MCPToolManager

  - MCPServerManager


  ## Target Base Classes

  - AsyncServiceBase: For async MCP services

  - ConfigServiceBase: For MCP configuration services

  - LifecycleServiceBase: For complex lifecycle management

  - ServiceFactory: For standardized creation


  ## Implementation Steps

  1. Refactor MCPGatewayService to use AsyncServiceBase

  2. Update MCPConfigurationService to use ConfigServiceBase

  3. Migrate tool and server managers to use ManagerBase

  4. Standardize state management across all MCP services

  5. Update service factory registrations

  6. Test MCP Gateway functionality


  ## Expected Outcomes

  - Consistent state management across MCP services

  - Standardized configuration loading

  - Better error handling and recovery

  - Reduced code duplication


  ## Files to Modify

  - src/claude_mpm/services/mcp_gateway/*.py

  - MCP service configurations


  ## Testing Requirements

  - MCP Gateway must start and stop correctly

  - Tool registration and management must work

  - Configuration loading must be preserved

  - All MCP operations must function correctly'
