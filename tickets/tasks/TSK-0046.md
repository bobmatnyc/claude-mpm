# Reorganize service layer architecture

## Description
Restructure the service layer for better separation of concerns and maintainability. Assigned to Engineer Agent.

**COMPLETED**: Successfully reorganized the service layer architecture into a modular structure with clear separation of concerns.

## Details
- **Status**: completed
- **Priority**: high
- **Assignees**: None
- **Tags**: phase2, service-layer, architecture, auto-extracted, source:ticket-cli, in-progress, task, engineer-agent
- **Created**: 2025-08-13 21:17:01
- **Updated**: 2025-08-13 21:17:01

## Tasks
- [x] Create new service directory structure under src/claude_mpm/services/
- [x] Move interfaces from core/interfaces.py to services/core/interfaces.py  
- [x] Reorganize agent services into services/agent/ directory
- [x] Move communication services to services/communication/
- [x] Move project services to services/project/
- [x] Create infrastructure services directory with logging and monitoring
- [x] Update import paths and add backward compatibility
- [x] Maintain backward compatibility with import aliases

## Notes

### Implementation Summary

Successfully reorganized the service layer with the following structure:

```
src/claude_mpm/services/
├── core/                  # Core service interfaces and base classes
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── interfaces.py      # Moved from core/interfaces.py
│   └── base.py           # New base service classes
├── agent/                 # Agent-related services  
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── deployment.py     # AgentDeploymentService
│   ├── management.py     # AgentManagementService
│   └── registry.py       # AgentRegistry
├── communication/         # Communication services
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── socketio.py       # SocketIOServer
│   └── websocket.py      # WebSocket utilities
├── project/              # Project management
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── analyzer.py       # ProjectAnalyzer
│   └── registry.py       # ProjectRegistry
└── infrastructure/       # Infrastructure services
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── logging.py        # New LoggingService
    └── monitoring.py     # HealthMonitor
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **Better Organization**: Services are now grouped by functional area
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Each service directory has a specific purpose
3. **Improved Discoverability**: Related services are co-located
4. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing imports continue to work
5. **Base Classes**: Added BaseService, SyncBaseService, and SingletonService for consistency
6. **Future Ready**: Structure supports easy addition of new services

### Backward Compatibility:
- Main services/__init__.py updated with lazy imports
- Original core/interfaces.py redirects to new location
- All existing code continues to work without modification
