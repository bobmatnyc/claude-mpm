    \ Refactoring\n\nBased on comprehensive codebase analysis, identified the following\
    \ priority files for refactoring (all >800 lines):\n\n### Top 5 Priority Files\
    \ for Next Refactoring:\n\n1. **monitoring.py** (1,034 lines) - Infrastructure\
    \ Service\n   - 8 classes handling different health check responsibilities\n \
    \  - High cohesion issue: ProcessResourceChecker (267 lines), NetworkConnectivityChecker\
    \ (90 lines), ServiceHealthChecker (209 lines)\n   - Recommendation: Extract into\
    \ separate checker services\n\n2. **agent_lifecycle_manager.py** (1,020 lines)\
    \ - Agent Deployment Service\n   - 5 classes, 25 async methods\n   - Single large\
    \ manager class with multiple lifecycle responsibilities\n   - Recommendation:\
    \ Extract state management, operation handling, and record keeping\n\n3. **analyzer.py**\
    \ (1,012 lines) - Project Analysis Service\n   - 2 classes, 21 methods in main\
    \ class\n   - ProjectAnalyzer handles too many analysis types\n   - Recommendation:\
    \ Extract language-specific analyzers and metrics collectors\n\n4. **tickets.py**\
    \ (965 lines) - CLI Command\n   - Single monolithic class with 25 methods\n  \
    \ - Handles all ticket operations in one place\n   - Recommendation: Extract ticket\

    \ Version Control Service\n   - 5 classes, 26 methods\n   - Mixed responsibilities:\
    \ parsing, comparison, validation, and formatting\n   - Recommendation: Separate\
    \ version parsing from operations\n\n### Additional High-Priority Files (890-960\
    \ lines):\n- **unified_paths.py** (938 lines) - 47 methods, path resolution god\

    4. semantic_versioning.py last as it's more isolated\n\nEach refactoring should\
    \ follow the established pattern:\n- Extract services with single responsibilities\n\
    - Implement dependency injection\n- Add comprehensive tests before refactoring\n\

# Code Health Analysis - Critical Technical Debt Remediation

## Description
Comprehensive code health analysis revealed critical technical debt requiring immediate remediation. The codebase health score is 48.6/100 (Grade: F) with 219 critical issues identified.

Key Metrics:
- Overall Health Score: 48.6/100 (Grade: F)
- Lines of Code: 125,111 across 396 files  
- Critical Issues: 219 total
- Security Vulnerabilities: 58 identified
- Architecture Violations: 32 cross-domain service violations
- Interface Coverage: Only 11.4% of services have interfaces (target: 80%)

P0 - Immediate Action Required:
1. God Classes: 10 massive classes (500-2000+ lines) violating single responsibility
2. Security Vulnerabilities: 58 total (49 SQL injection, 9 bare exception handlers)
3. Missing Service Architecture: No working dependency injection container

Action Plan:
Phase 1: Critical Security & Stability (Week 1-2)
Phase 2: Architecture Implementation (Week 3-4) 
Phase 3: Code Quality (Week 5-6)

Success Criteria:
- Health score improved to 70+/100
- Zero P0 security vulnerabilities
- 80% service interface coverage
