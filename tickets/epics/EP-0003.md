# Code Health Analysis - Critical Technical Debt Remediation

## Description
Comprehensive code health analysis revealed critical technical debt requiring immediate remediation. The codebase health score is 48.6/100 (Grade: F) with 219 critical issues identified.

Key Metrics:
- Overall Health Score: 48.6/100 (Grade: F)
- Lines of Code: 125,111 across 396 files  
- Critical Issues: 219 total
- Security Vulnerabilities: 58 identified
- Architecture Violations: 32 cross-domain service violations
- Interface Coverage: Only 11.4% of services have interfaces (target: 80%)

P0 - Immediate Action Required:
1. God Classes: 10 massive classes (500-2000+ lines) violating single responsibility
2. Security Vulnerabilities: 58 total (49 SQL injection, 9 bare exception handlers)
3. Missing Service Architecture: No working dependency injection container

Action Plan:
Phase 1: Critical Security & Stability (Week 1-2)
Phase 2: Architecture Implementation (Week 3-4) 
Phase 3: Code Quality (Week 5-6)

Success Criteria:
- Health score improved to 70+/100
- Zero P0 security vulnerabilities
- 80% service interface coverage
