# Implement Memory Guardian System for Claude Code Auto-Restart

## Description
Implement an intelligent Memory Guardian System that automatically monitors Claude Code memory usage and performs graceful restarts when thresholds are exceeded, preserving user context across restarts.

## Background
Claude Code can accumulate large memory usage over time, potentially reaching 18GB+ which impacts system performance and can cause system instability. We need an intelligent monitoring and restart system that preserves user context while maintaining system stability.

## Problem Statement
- Claude Code memory usage can grow to 18GB+ over extended sessions
- Large memory usage impacts system performance and stability
- Current solution requires manual restarts with context loss
- No automated monitoring or intervention system exists

## Solution Overview
Implement a Memory Guardian System using subprocess.Popen for process management that:
- Continuously monitors Claude Code memory usage
- Automatically restarts the process when thresholds are exceeded
- Preserves user context and state across restarts
- Prevents restart loops and provides graceful shutdown
- Supports cross-platform operation (macOS, Linux, Windows)

## Goals & Objectives
- **Primary Goal**: Automatically restart Claude Code when memory exceeds 18GB threshold
- **Secondary Objectives**: 
  - Preserve user context across restarts
  - Prevent restart loops through intelligent backoff
  - Provide configurable thresholds for different scenarios
  - Support cross-platform operation
  - Integrate seamlessly with existing claude-mpm framework

## Success Metrics
- Memory usage stays below 18GB through automatic restarts
- Zero data loss during restart process
- <30 second restart time with context preservation
- 99%+ uptime with restart loop protection
- Works reliably across macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Configurable thresholds: Warning: 12GB, Critical: 15GB, Emergency: 18GB

## Key Features
1. **MemoryGuardian Service** - subprocess.Popen-based process monitoring and management
2. **Configurable Thresholds** - Warning: 12GB, Critical: 15GB, Emergency: 18GB
3. **State Preservation System** - Context maintained across restarts using atomic serialization
4. **Platform Compatibility** - Native support for macOS, Linux, Windows
5. **CLI Integration** - New 'run-guarded' command with configuration options
6. **Safety Features** - Restart loop protection, graceful shutdown, exponential backoff

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- MemoryGuardian service foundation with subprocess.Popen
