description: 'Migrate existing configuration loading patterns to use the new shared
  ConfigLoader and PathResolver utilities.


  ## Scope

  Update 25+ modules that load configuration:

  - Replace direct Config() usage with ConfigLoader patterns

  - Standardize path resolution with PathResolver

  - Eliminate duplicate environment variable handling

  - Implement consistent configuration caching


  ## Target Duplication Reduction

  - Configuration Layer: 90% duplicate patterns → ~5% (85% reduction)

  - Estimated 60-80% code reduction in config-related code


  ## Utilities to Use

  - ConfigLoader: Centralized configuration loading with patterns

  - PathResolver: Standardized path resolution with environment support

  - SingletonManager: Thread-safe singleton patterns for config instances


  ## Deliverables

  - All modules use ConfigLoader instead of direct Config() instantiation

  - Consistent path resolution across all modules

  - Standardized environment variable handling

  - Centralized configuration caching

  - Updated configuration documentation


  ## Dependencies

  - Requires Phase 1 (Foundation) to be completed

  - Should be done after Phase 2 and 3 for maximum impact


  ## Estimated Effort

  1-2 hours for complete migration of configuration patterns


  ## Success Criteria

  - No direct Config() instantiation outside of ConfigLoader

  - All path resolution uses PathResolver

  - Consistent environment variable patterns

  - All tests pass after refactoring

  - Configuration loading is faster due to caching'
