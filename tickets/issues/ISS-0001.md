# Refactor high-complexity functions

## Description
Refactor 40 functions with complexity >10. Priority targets: _load_framework_content (23), run_session (19), main in cli.py (16). Apply clean code principles to reduce complexity below 10.

## Details
- **Status**: open
- **Type**: enhancement
- **Severity**: high
- **Assignees**: Engineer Agent
- **Tags**: EP-0001, code-quality
- **Created**: 2025-07-24 14:45:00
- **Updated**: 2025-07-24 17:30:00
- **Converted from**: TSK-0010

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All identified functions have complexity reduced below 10
- [ ] Clean code principles are applied consistently
- [ ] Code functionality remains unchanged
- [ ] Unit tests pass for all refactored functions

## Progress

### Completed Tasks
- **TSK-0020**: Refactored _load_framework_content function
  - Reduced complexity from 23 to 4
  - Extracted separate methods for different content types
  - Improved readability and maintainability
  - All tests passing after refactoring

- **TSK-0021**: Refactored run_session function
  - Reduced complexity from 19 to 8
  - Extracted separate methods for session initialization and execution
  - Improved error handling and logging
  - Maintained all existing functionality

- **TSK-0022**: Created OrchestratorFactory to simplify orchestrator instantiation
  - Implemented `src/claude_mpm/core/orchestrator_factory.py`
  - Centralized orchestrator creation logic
  - Reduced complexity in multiple locations
  - Improved maintainability and consistency

- **TSK-0023**: Created CLI registries for better command organization
  - Implemented `src/claude_mpm/cli/registries.py`
  - Centralized command and option registration
  - Reduced complexity in cli.py main function
  - Improved command management and extensibility

### Complexity Reduction Progress
- Initial high-complexity functions: 40 (all with complexity >10)
- Functions addressed: 4+ (direct refactoring + factory/registry patterns)
- Major wins: 
  - _load_framework_content (23→4)
  - run_session (19→8)
  - Indirect complexity reduction through OrchestratorFactory
  - Indirect complexity reduction through CLI registries
- Remaining: ~35 functions still need refactoring

### Impact Summary
The refactoring efforts have achieved:
1. **Direct refactoring**: 2 high-complexity functions simplified
2. **Factory pattern**: Reduced orchestrator instantiation complexity
3. **Registry pattern**: Simplified CLI command management
4. **Overall improvement**: Better code organization and maintainability

### Priority Targets Still Remaining
1. `main` in cli.py (complexity reduced but still needs work)
2. `_execute_tool` in various orchestrators
3. `_handle_response` methods across orchestrators
4. Other functions identified in initial complexity analysis

### Utility Foundation Completed
While not directly refactoring complex functions, the following utilities enable broader refactoring efforts:
- **SubprocessRunner**: Enables simplification of complex subprocess handling in orchestrators
- **PathOperations**: Allows extraction of complex file operations from main functions
- **ConfigurationManager**: Facilitates refactoring of complex config loading logic

These utilities provide the foundation needed for the next phase of complexity reduction.

### Integration Phase Impact on Complexity

#### Indirect Complexity Improvements from Utility Integration
The utility integration phase has laid significant groundwork for complexity reduction:

- **TSK-0038**: SubprocessRunner integration (6 orchestrator files)
  - Many orchestrator methods now have simpler subprocess handling
  - Complex error handling logic replaced with utility calls
  - Estimated complexity reduction of 2-4 points per method
  
- **TSK-0039**: PathOperations integration (8 service files)
  - File operation complexity extracted from main logic flows
  - Complex validation logic centralized in utility
  - Estimated complexity reduction of 1-3 points per method
  
- **TSK-0045**: ConfigurationManager integration (8 config files)
  - Configuration loading simplified across the codebase
  - Complex validation and error handling centralized
  - Estimated complexity reduction of 2-3 points per method

#### Foundation for Systematic Refactoring
With all utilities now integrated:
1. **Subprocess handling**: Ready to simplify all orchestrator `_execute_tool` methods
2. **File operations**: Can extract complexity from file-heavy functions
3. **Configuration**: Can simplify all config-related methods
4. **Import handling**: Already simplified across codebase
5. **Logging**: Consistent interface reduces boilerplate complexity

### Next Steps - Leveraging Integration Work
- Use integrated SubprocessRunner to refactor remaining orchestrator methods
- Apply integrated PathOperations to simplify file-heavy functions
- Leverage ConfigurationManager integration for config method refactoring
- Target the ~35 remaining high-complexity functions systematically
- Focus on `main` in cli.py and orchestrator response handling methods

## Notes
This issue addresses code quality improvements needed in the codebase. High-complexity functions make the code harder to maintain, test, and understand.
