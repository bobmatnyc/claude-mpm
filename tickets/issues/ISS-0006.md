# Optimize async operations performance

## Description
16.2% of functions are async. Profile async operations, identify bottlenecks, implement proper async patterns, reduce overhead. Focus on orchestration and service layers.

## Details
- **Status**: open
- **Type**: enhancement
- **Severity**: low
- **Assignees**: Engineer Agent
- **Tags**: EP-0001, performance
- **Created**: 2025-07-24 14:45:00
- **Updated**: 2025-07-24 14:45:00
- **Converted from**: TSK-0015

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Async operations profiled and bottlenecks identified
- [ ] Proper async/await patterns implemented consistently
- [ ] Unnecessary async overhead removed
- [ ] Performance improvements measured and documented
- [ ] No race conditions or deadlocks introduced
- [ ] Tests verify async behavior correctness

## Notes
This issue addresses performance improvements. While async operations enable concurrency, improper implementation can introduce overhead and complexity.
