description: 'Migrate existing service classes to use the new base classes and shared
  patterns.


  ## Scope

  Refactor 20+ service classes to use base classes:

  - Agent services, memory services, MCP services, monitoring services

  - Replace duplicate initialization patterns with base class inheritance

  - Standardize configuration loading and state management

  - Implement consistent lifecycle management


  ## Target Duplication Reduction

  - Service Classes: 70% duplicate patterns → ~20% (50% reduction)

  - Estimated 30-50% code reduction per service file


  ## Base Classes to Use

  - AsyncServiceBase: For async services with state management

  - ConfigServiceBase: For configuration-heavy services

  - LifecycleServiceBase: For services with complex lifecycle

  - ManagerBase: For manager-style services with item collections

  - ServiceFactory: For standardized service creation


  ## Deliverables

  - All service classes refactored to use appropriate base classes

  - Consistent configuration loading patterns

  - Standardized state management and lifecycle

  - Updated service factory registrations

  - Comprehensive tests for refactored services


  ## Dependencies

  - Requires Phase 1 (Foundation) to be completed

  - Can be done in parallel with Phase 2 (CLI Migration)


  ## Estimated Effort

  3-4 hours for complete migration of all service classes


  ## Success Criteria

  - All services inherit from appropriate base classes

  - No duplicate initialization or configuration patterns

  - Consistent state management across all services

  - All tests pass after refactoring

  - Service factory can create all services'
