    ### Work Summary

    Successfully replaced 420+ lines of static QA routing instructions with dynamic
    agent discovery system. The PM now uses runtime metadata from agent templates
    for intelligent routing decisions.


    ### Key Changes

    1. **Agent Templates**: Added routing metadata with keywords, paths, extensions,
    and priorities

    2. **WORKFLOW.md**: Reduced by 272 lines with dynamic routing reference

    3. **INSTRUCTIONS.md**: Reduced by 150 lines, removed duplicate routing logic

    4. **framework_loader.py**: Enhanced to expose routing metadata to PM


    ### Testing Completed

    - All QA agent templates validated with routing sections

    - Framework loader correctly extracts and exposes routing data

    - 8 routing scenarios tested with 100% accuracy

    - No duplicate documentation remaining


    ### Next Steps for Future Session

    1. Deploy the updated agents to activate routing metadata

    2. Test PM routing decisions with real-world tasks

    3. Monitor performance impact of dynamic routing

    4. Consider extending routing metadata to other agent types'
