  ## Story Points: 13

  ## Tasks: - Create unit tests for Hello World tool with full coverage - Create unit
  tests for Document Summarizer with edge cases - Build stdio test client for development
  and debugging - Create integration test framework for MCP communication - Add performance
  benchmarks and memory usage tests - Implement test fixtures and mock data generation
  - Set up continuous testing with GitHub Actions

  ## Acceptance Criteria: - [ ] Unit tests achieve >80% code coverage across all components
  - [ ] Hello World tool tests cover all functionality and edge cases - [ ] Document
  Summarizer tests include large files and edge cases - [ ] Stdio test client successfully
  communicates with MCP server - [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end MCP communication
  - [ ] Performance benchmarks establish baseline metrics - [ ] Memory usage tests
  validate <50MB target - [ ] Test fixtures provide realistic test data - [ ] Mock
  implementations for external dependencies - [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs all tests automatically
  - [ ] Test reports generated with coverage metrics - [ ] Load testing for concurrent
  tool usage

  ## Technical Notes: - Use pytest and pytest-asyncio for async testing - Mock MCP
  communication for unit tests - Create realistic test documents of various sizes
  - Benchmark against memory and performance targets - Include stress testing for
  edge cases - Test on multiple Python versions (3.8+)'
