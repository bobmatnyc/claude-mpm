# Refactor framework_loader.py - Extract Services and Implement DI

## Description
## Summary
Successfully refactored the framework_loader.py god class by extracting services and implementing dependency injection.

## Progress
- **Original Size**: 2069 lines with Cyclomatic Complexity of 331
- **Current Size**: 1605 lines (22.4% reduction)
- **Total Lines Removed**: 464 lines

## Services Extracted

### 1. CacheManager Service
- Thread-safe caching with TTL management
- Multiple cache types support
- Full test coverage (16 tests)

### 2. ServiceContainer 
- Complete dependency injection framework
- Singleton, Transient, and Scoped lifetimes
- Circular dependency detection
- Auto-wiring based on type hints
- Full test coverage (24 tests)

### 3. PathResolver Service
- Framework path detection (packaged vs development)
- NPM global path resolution
- Deployment context management
- Instruction file path resolution with precedence
- Full test coverage (43 tests)

### 4. MemoryManager Service
- Memory loading, aggregation, and deduplication
- Legacy format migration
- Agent-specific memory handling
- Full test coverage (14 tests)

## Key Achievements
- Reduced responsibilities from 12+ to ~8
- Implemented SOLID principles
- Added comprehensive unit tests before refactoring
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Established foundation for future refactoring

## Test Coverage
- Created comprehensive unit tests BEFORE refactoring (30+ tests)
- All new services have full test coverage (97 tests total)
- Integration tests verify backward compatibility

## Next Steps
- Extract AgentDiscoveryService (~300 lines)
- Extract InstructionProcessor (~200 lines)
- Extract ContentFormatter (~150 lines)
- Update architecture documentation
