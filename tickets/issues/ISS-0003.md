# Increase test coverage to 80%

## Description
Current coverage: 23.6%. Focus on: CLI entry points, orchestration layer, core services. Implement unit tests, integration tests, and E2E test suite.

## Details
- **Status**: open
- **Type**: enhancement
- **Severity**: critical
- **Assignees**: QA Agent
- **Tags**: EP-0001, testing
- **Created**: 2025-07-24 14:45:00
- **Updated**: 2025-07-24 14:45:00
- **Converted from**: TSK-0012

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test coverage reaches at least 80%
- [ ] CLI entry points have comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Orchestration layer has full integration test coverage
- [ ] Core services have both unit and integration tests
- [ ] E2E test suite covers main user workflows
- [ ] All tests pass consistently in CI/CD pipeline

## Notes
This issue addresses quality assurance improvements. Low test coverage increases the risk of regressions and makes refactoring dangerous.
