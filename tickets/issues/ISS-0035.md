## Notes
### Implementation Progress (2025-08-15)
- Infrastructure foundation from ISS-0034 has been completed
- MCP Gateway service structure is in place with:
  - Core interfaces defined (IMCPServer, IMCPToolRegistry, etc.)
  - Base service class implemented with async lifecycle
  - Configuration system ready with YAML support
  - Exception hierarchy established
- Ready to implement the server and registry components
- Next steps: Implement WebSocket/SSE handlers and tool registration system

### Implementation Completed (2025-08-15)
- ✅ **MCP Server Implementation** (`src/claude_mpm/services/mcp_gateway/server/`)
  - `mcp_server.py`: Full MCP server with official package support
  - `mcp_server_simple.py`: Simplified server for testing/fallback
  - `stdio_handler.py`: STDIO communication handler with JSON-RPC support
  - Both implementations support the `stop()` method from IMCPLifecycle
  
- ✅ **Tool Registry System** (`src/claude_mpm/services/mcp_gateway/registry/`)
  - `tool_registry.py`: Thread-safe registry with full CRUD operations
  - Support for tool categories (system, user, builtin, external)
  - Tool search and discovery capabilities
  - Comprehensive metrics tracking
  - LRU cache for frequently used tools
  
- ✅ **Service Registry** (`src/claude_mpm/services/mcp_gateway/registry/service_registry.py`)
  - Dependency injection container
  - Service lifecycle management
  - Health check capabilities
  - Singleton and transient service support
  
- ✅ **Tool Adapters** (`src/claude_mpm/services/mcp_gateway/tools/base_adapter.py`)
  - Base adapter class with validation and metrics
  - Example implementations: Echo, Calculator, SystemInfo
  - Full async support
  
- ✅ **Main Entry Point** (`src/claude_mpm/services/mcp_gateway/main.py`)
  - Complete orchestration of all components
  - Graceful shutdown handling
  - CLI argument support
  - Configuration file support
  
- ✅ **Testing** (`scripts/test_mcp_server.py`)
  - Comprehensive test suite covering all components
  - All acceptance criteria verified
  - 100% test pass rate

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **Protocol Compliance**: Full MCP protocol support with JSON-RPC 2.0
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with structured logging
3. **Thread Safety**: Registry uses RLock for concurrent access
4. **Performance**: LRU caching, lazy loading, metrics tracking
5. **Extensibility**: Interface-based design for easy extension
6. **Lifecycle Management**: Full async lifecycle (initialize, start, stop, restart)
7. **Tool Discovery**: Search by name, description, regex patterns
8. **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks for all services

### Previous Progress
- Started implementing MCP Server using Anthropic's official MCP package
- Building on infrastructure from ISS-0034 (interfaces and base classes)
- Implementing stdio-based communication following MCP protocol specifications
- Creating comprehensive tool registry with thread-safe operations
- Adding robust error handling and structured logging throughout
