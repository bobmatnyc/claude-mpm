description: 'Comprehensive end-to-end testing with actual Claude Code installation.

  ## Story Points: 8

  ## Tasks: - Test MCP Gateway with actual Claude Code installation - Verify tool
  discovery works correctly in Claude Code interface - Test document summarization
  with real files and measure results - Validate memory usage reduction against baseline
  measurements - Perform comprehensive performance testing under various loads - Test
  installation and setup procedures on clean systems - Validate all CLI commands work
  in production environment

  ## Acceptance Criteria: - [ ] MCP Gateway successfully integrates with Claude Code
  - [ ] Tools are properly discoverable in Claude Code interface - [ ] Document Summarizer
  processes real files correctly - [ ] Memory usage stays consistently under 50MB
  baseline - [ ] Performance targets met (response time <2s for typical documents)
  - [ ] Installation procedures work on clean systems - [ ] All CLI commands function
  correctly in production - [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully - [ ] Performance
  metrics meet or exceed targets - [ ] Memory reduction of 60%+ validated with real
  documents - [ ] System stability maintained under extended usage - [ ] Compatibility
  verified across supported Python versions

  ## Technical Notes: - Test with various document types and sizes - Measure memory
  usage before and after implementation - Include stress testing with concurrent requests
  - Validate against Claude Code''s actual integration requirements - Document any
  platform-specific issues discovered - Create test reports with metrics and benchmarks'
