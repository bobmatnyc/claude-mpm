# Split god classes using Single Responsibility Principle

## Description
Refactor 7 god classes: EnhancedBaseService (34 methods), AgentLifecycleManager (27), ParentDirectoryManager (26), and 4 others. Apply SRP to break into smaller, focused classes.

## Details
- **Status**: open
- **Type**: enhancement
- **Severity**: high
- **Assignees**: Engineer Agent
- **Tags**: EP-0001, architecture
- **Created**: 2025-07-24 14:45:00
- **Updated**: 2025-07-24 14:45:00
- **Converted from**: TSK-0011

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Each god class is split into multiple focused classes
- [ ] Each new class follows Single Responsibility Principle
- [ ] Existing functionality is preserved
- [ ] Dependencies are properly managed between new classes
- [ ] Tests are updated to reflect new class structure

## Notes
This issue addresses architectural improvements. God classes violate the Single Responsibility Principle and make the codebase harder to maintain and extend.
