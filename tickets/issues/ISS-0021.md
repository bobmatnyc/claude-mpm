description: 'Create a comprehensive test implementation and proof-of-concept for
  the PM Instruction Reinforcement System to validate the technical approach before
  full development.


  SCOPE:

  This issue covers the initial test implementation phase to prove the concept and
  validate technical assumptions.


  ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:

  - Create minimal daemon prototype that monitors conversation events

  - Implement basic TodoWrite hook interception

  - Test reminder injection mechanism

  - Validate Socket.IO event monitoring on ports 8765-8785

  - Document test results and technical findings

  - Identify implementation challenges and solutions

  - Provide architectural recommendations for full implementation


  TECHNICAL TASKS:

  1. Study existing TodoAgentPrefixHook implementation

  2. Create test daemon with minimal monitoring capabilities

  3. Implement basic hook interception for TodoWrite

  4. Test Socket.IO event listening and processing

  5. Create sample reminder injection scenarios

  6. Document hook system integration points

  7. Validate PM processing of injected reminders

  8. Performance testing with conversation simulation

  9. Configuration file structure design

  10. Test report and recommendations


  DELIVERABLES:

  - Working prototype code in test directory

  - Technical documentation of approach

  - Test scenarios and validation results

  - Architecture recommendations

  - Implementation roadmap for full system
