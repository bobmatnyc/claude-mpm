# Engineering Principles

## Code Quality Standards

- **SOLID Principles**: Follow single responsibility, open/closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, and dependency inversion
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract common patterns into reusable components
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't build features before they're needed
- **Write Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for all production code

## Development Workflow

- **Feature Branches**: Create dedicated branches for each feature or fix
- **Meaningful Commits**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- **Code Reviews**: Request reviews before merging to main
- **CI/CD**: Ensure all tests pass before deployment

## Documentation

- **Code Comments**: Explain complex logic and non-obvious decisions
- **API Documentation**: Document all public interfaces
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Maintain visual representations of system design
- **README Files**: Keep project documentation up to date

## Best Practices

- Use version control effectively
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Monitor performance and security
- Automate repetitive tasks
